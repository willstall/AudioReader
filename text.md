ABSTRACT
Once a year over the week leading up to and including Labor Day, tens of thousands of people drive hours into Nevada’s barren Black Rock Desert to build an ephemeral city equal to “the size of downtown San Francisco.” This place, Black Rock City, home of the annual Burning Man event, only exists for a fraction of the year. For one week, participants gather together at Burning Man and operate under its ten guiding principles, including “radical self-reliance,” “communal effort,” “radical self- expression,” and “participation.” Everything, with the exception of porta-potties and ice, must be brought in and packed out by individuals. The decommodified, volunteer-run city is what its inhabitants make of it. At Burning Man, attendants are their own event planners, food providers, structure builders, gift givers, and activity coordinators. On the penultimate night of the event, an effigy of a forty-foot man is set aflame, a ritual left open for interpretation by participants. Two days later, the entirety of Black Rock City is torn down, leaving scarcely any trace that it ever even existed.
Burning Man has gained social traction exponentially since its launch in 1986, leading to the formation of dozens of individually organized regional burns across the United States of America and internationally. Scholars from many disciplines have flocked to the event attempting to unpack its distinct subculture. While publications have analyzed Burning Man’s ethos, logistics, business organization, community, art, rituals, fire, and performances, only two have considered sound worthy of focus and few have addressed the regional burn network.
“Aural Substance: An Ethnographic Exploration of Regional Burn Soundscapes”
analyzes Burning Man’s regional network, expanding on sound artists Stephan Moore

and Scott Smallwood’s brief initial study of the national event's sound by way of ethnography and field recording. From June 2016 through February 2017, I conducted fieldwork and collected fifty-five hours of field recordings at seven different regional burns. I employ ethnomusicologist Steven Feld’s concept of “acoustemology,” or “sound as a way of knowing.” Through my observation, analysis of recordings, and interviews, I consider how the sounds at regional burns can signify the time, date, and location to burn participants. Sound-studies scholar David Novak writes that “noise is a crucial element of communicational and cultural networks.” In this study, I analyze how noise at a burn is not solely a by-product of participants’ “anarchistic freedom,” but a key part of the burn that relays information about regional burn values, public and private spaces, and burners’ lived experience.

CHAPTER ONE OVERVIEW Preface
I remember a day in tenth grade, lounging on my best friend’s couch surfing the video-on-demand choices, a typical activity for us two teenage girls on a weekend. My best friend, Erica, decided on a documentary called Burning Man: Beyond Black Rock (2005), insisting that she had heard of Burning Man before and thought it sounded “pretty cool.” Within minutes I was wide-eyed, drawn to the images on the screen: large scale art, transported to and displayed in the middle of the harsh Nevada desert; costumed fire- spinners, surrounded by groups of onlookers, doing tricks with circus props I had never seen before; massive “art cars” roaming the desert, decorated to look like anything from pirate ships, to sperm whales, to angler fish. I recall wondering: who is “the man?” and why are they burning him down? At age sixteen, I was too young to fully grasp the concepts explored in the film, but my eyes had been opened, my curiosity piqued. I remember wishing that someday, I too could be one of the dust-covered, goggle-wearing, radiant human beings like the ones on the screen... holding the knowledge to the mysterious world of Burning Man.1
Fast forward seven years and I had all but forgotten about the documentary that had filled me with so much wonder, until at a birthday party, my friend Will started

 married her partner on the playa.

practicing with his poi.2 When I asked where and how he learned how to spin, he replied that he had picked it up at regional burns and I immediately remembered my teenage aspirations.3 I was off... asking Will question after question about the events—what goes on there, how they work, how much they cost, what kind of preparation and gear they require—and he happily answered every one of my questions. For most of the evening, Will enthusiastically regaled me with stories about his burn experiences and by the end of it, I was as wide-eyed and intrigued as on the day Erica and I discovered that film.4 “You’re such a burner and you don’t even know it,” Will told me, as we bid each other good-bye at the end of the evening. It was then that I vowed to make it to a burn within the next year.
The following summer in July 2014, my partner Monty and I made the drive to Transformus, North Carolina’s regional burn.5 Nothing, not my experience attending music festivals, nor my reading every piece of information I could find on Transformus (from the “First Time Guide” (Pyrocelt 2017) on the Transformus website to the discussions in the Transformus Facebook groups), could have prepared me for the
                                                      
2 Nick Woolsey (2015) describes poi as “a form of dance, where weights on the ends of tethers are swung through rhythmical patterns.” Poi are a popular form of fire- spinning at Burning Man events.
3 “Spin” is a colloquial term used to describe the act of flow-arts/fire-spinning.
4 Katherine Chen has written about how burners use storytelling “as a mechanism for meaning-making and promoting agency” (Chen 2012b, 312).
5 Transformus was held at Deerfields, a venue in Horseshoe, NC, from 2004- 2016. Transformus is the second largest regional burn on the East-coast, capped each year at 2,500 participants (Transformus 2017b). It is second to Alchemy, Georgia’s fall regional burn, which overtook Transformus as the most highly populated regional burn
on the East-coast in 2011 with 2,791 tickets sold (Flashpoint Arts Initiative 2017).

overwhelming experience that is a “virgin’s” first burn.6 I do not presume to think that my virgin burn was akin to that of all virgin burners. I can only speak for myself, as there is no universal burn experience. But what struck me the most were the vast, multifarious, incessant sounds that I encountered. Perhaps this was because of my background as a lifetime musician and as a teacher, both occupations in which active listening is not only valued, but also required for success. But I could not stop hearing; I could not stop listening.7 Sound permeated every waking moment of my burn and often was the cause that kept me awake or woke me from my rare and much needed slumber. I could retreat to my tent, I could close my eyes, I could put my earplugs in, but even then, I could not close my ears. Even now as I think back on my first Transformus, laying awake in my tent, I can hear the far away wobble of bass and thump-thumping of four- on-the-floor dance beats.8 I can hear the muffled sounds of conversation and laughter permeating through my earplugs. I can hear the jolting WHOOSH-sound of propane
                                                      
6 First time burn participants are known within the community as “virgins.” Virgin’s are typically gently hazed by the community during their first burn: receiving (consensual) spankings upon arrival by the gate/greeters station, being called out as a “virgin” for the duration of the event, and being schooled in the “ten principles” by the burn community.
7 The difference between “hearing” and “listening” is a common theme in sound- studies literature and has been explored by scholars such as Jonathan Sterne and Tom Rice. The hearing ear is discussed as “something operational, quantifiable, and separable” from ones’ subjective experience, a passive function (Sterne 2015, 68). Listening, by contrast, “is understood to involve a deliberate channeling of attention toward a sound” (Rice 2015, 99) and “emphasizes the role of social and cultural context in auditory attention” (Ibid., 101).

igniting atop massive fire poofers.9 I can hear the howls and yelps of ecstatic denizens of the night, the hum of multiple generators running concurrently, the sirens of megaphones, the crunching of gravel under the weight of a golf-cart passing by.10 Amidst this plethora of unusual sounds, I meditated my way to sleep by concentrating on the steady glug- glugging of my heartbeat and the wave-like rise and fall of my breath. My memories of that first burn, and all subsequent burns for that matter, are firmly rooted in sound.
I returned home from my first burn and a month later began the Masters in Musicology program at Temple University. Over the course of my graduate degree program, I became increasingly involved in the East-coast regional burn culture during my spare time: founding and organizing a theme camp, attending local Philadelphia burner-promoted events, connecting online to the East-coast regional burn communities, meeting and making friends with burners, and attending additional regional burns, such as Frostburn 2015/2016 and Transformus 2016.11 Essentially, my life outside of graduate school was all-things-burning-all-the-time. Through my graduate school coursework, I became aware of the increasingly popular field of sound studies, as well as the method of ethnography, employed by many ethnomusicologists and sound studies scholars. So

group projects year round. Theme camps are discussed in greater depth on page 16.

when it came time to choose a topic for my final musicology writing project, naturally I thought of the sounds of the regional burn community that had so enraptured me. But what about the sounds was so compelling? Were other burners similarly intrigued by the burn soundscape? If what scholar Erik Davis says about Burning Man is true, “that you can’t say anything very penetrating about [it] because its diversity and contradictions undermine any generalization you might be tempted to make,” could I definitively say what burns sounded like? (Davis 2005, 15). And even if I could, what would the benefits be of such an endeavor? This document is the result of my queries, a report on my six- month ethnographic exploration into regional burns and their soundscapes; an aural perspective on Burning Man’s regional subculture and events.
Introduction
This project started with the central question: what can be learned about regional
burns by listening to what they sound like? To answer this question, from June 2016 through February 2017 I traveled to seven different regional burns in order to conduct, what I am calling, aural ethnography: a combination of participant observation as well as the systematic collection of soundscape audio recordings. (A soundscape, as defined by sound studies scholar R. Murray Schafer, is “any acoustic field of study” (1977, 7) that “consists of events heard not objects seen” (Ibid., 8).12  While I would like to jump right in and explain everything I discovered, I find that I must first offer an overview of what it
                                                      
12 However, as other sound studies scholars, such as Stefan Helmreich (2010) and Andrew J. Eisenberg (2015), have shown, Schafer’s definition of soundscape is problematic in that it values ecological sounds over all others. My study opens up Schafer’s definition of soundscape to include people and technological sounds, which, as
I will show, are crucial to understanding burn culture.

means to do aural ethnography, as well as situate my project by explaining what “a burn” is, and why studies on burn culture matter.
Aural Ethnography
When something is “aural,” it means that it is “of or related to the ear or to the
sense of hearing.”13 Ethnography is in-depth study and analysis of a culture or society, that usually results in an ethnography, a written account of the conducted fieldwork. For nearly a century, anthropologists have recognized how much one can learn about a culture by living in it: by listening, feeling, tasting, smelling, and seeing it day in and day out. Hence the method of participant observation (which I used extensively in my study), became cultural and social anthropology’s primary method of information gathering. Sound studies scholars David Novak and Matt Sakakeeny acknowledge that anthropologists have particularly apprehended “the deeply coconstitutive relationship of sound and culture” (2015, 6), how sound “is a substance of the world as well as a basic part of how people frame their knowledge about the world” (Ibid., 2). However, because western academic practices tend to value the visual sense above all others—for example, the visual arts, the musical score, and the written word—the experience of sound (and the other senses: touch, smell, taste) have historically been overlooked.14 This is surprising,
                                                      
13 Merriam-Webster. s.v. “Aural,” accessed April 15, 2017, https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/aural.
14 Numerous scholars across the fields of musicology, dance, and anthropology have discussed the privileging of the visual sense above all others. Makagon and Neumann, Rose, and Stoller particularly call for ethnographers to incorporate the other senses into their ethnographic writings. See Cusick (1994), Foster (2010), Goehr (1992), Makagon and Neumann (2009), Rose (1990), Schafer (1977), Small (1998), and Stoller (1989).

given that anthropologists as far back as Bronislaw Malinowki and Franz Boas pressed the importance of listening to their ethnographic environments. As anthropologists Christian Meyer and Nikolaus Schareika point out about these early and influential figures’ work, Malinowski (1922) “more often recurs to what people say than to what they do without words” and Franz Boas (1911) “regarded linguistics and ethnology as inseparable” (Meyer and Schareika 2009, 4-5). In other words, as sound studies scholar Tim Rice writes, “it is well recognized that auditory engagement is a key component of ethnographic fieldwork” (2015, 106).15 Yet, in spite of this, Novak and Sakakeeny note that sound itself was not “recognized as a distinct subject of study until the end of the twentieth century” (2015, 6). Sound studies, then, is a relatively new discipline and much sound-centric work is still needed. Aural ethnography asks what can be learned about a culture, or in my case regional burn culture, by shifting ethnographers’ historically visual priority to an aural one.16 At each burn, I conducted participant observation and took hours of soundscape recordings. My goal in this work is not to write a broad aural ethnography about all the sounds one encounters at burns, though this was my initial objective. As I discovered, trying to explain and analyze all of the types of sounds one encounters at a burn would be impractical, not just because the amount of data would be overwhelming, but because as sound artists Stephan Moore, David Ogawa, and Scott
                                                      
15 Also see Forsey (2010).
16 Sound-centric ethnographic practices are not new but have not been codified as a method. Feld, with his fieldwork in the Bosavi rainforest in New Guinea, first began describing his sound-centric ethnographic practices as “anthropology of sound” in the 1980s (Brenneis and Feld 2004). Makagon and Neumann (2009) urge ethnographers to
use “audio documentary” as a qualitative research method.

Smallwood (2011) say, burns are “literally impossible to characterize in any single way.” What happens there changes from burn to burn and from year to year. Instead, I employ ethnomusicologist Steven Feld’s concept of “acoustemology,” interviews with burners, collected fieldwork data, selections from Burning Man scholarship, and my participant observation to analyze how participants at burns interpret and navigate their experience through sound. I build upon Moore and Smallwood’s article “The Soundscape of Burning Man” to explore how burn soundscapes not only signify time, date, and location, but also are an indicator of public and private spaces, and experience. My hope is that this thesis will: one, continue the process of bridging research between Burning Man, regional burns, and sound, and two, demonstrate, in line with Daniel Makagon and Mark Neumann’s book, Recording Culture, how sound-centric studies and audio recordings benefit ethnographic work by “cultivat[ing] a different, sometimes deeper, sense of an environment” (2009, 25).17
There are a few things that a reader of this ethnography should know before continuing. First, at a burn many participants (though not all) take on a so-called “burn name” or “playa name,” a nickname that they use for the duration of the burn. Throughout the work, I quote participants using the name I was introduced to them as, and so for someone unfamiliar to burn culture, these names, such as Pyrocelt and Tiger, may seem unusual. Second, referenced in the footnotes throughout the work are seventy- eight short samples of the more extended soundscape recordings I took during my
                                                      
17 I am inspired by Makagon and Neumann’s book, Recording Culture (2009), which urges ethnographers to include audio documentary as a qualitative method in their
 studies.

fieldwork. The sound-clips begin in the “Preface” and continue through “Appendix A.” Each sound-clip is numbered and intended to be listened to in context with its paired sentence. For the full soundscape effect, I recommend listening to the sound-clips through a pair of high quality headphones. Third, as stated in the preface, I had been immersed in burn culture as a participant for two years before I began my research. My involvement in the burn community and knowledge of burn culture has, as an ethnographer, allowed me insider access to regional burns and assisted in fostering trust with burn participants, many of whom might have otherwise been skeptical of my intentions. My experience as a Theme Camp Officer (TCO) prepared me with the knowledge necessary to decipher the insider semiotic functioning of regional burn sound signals, as well as how to plan for and behave at the burns themselves. While, from a research perspective, my insider access was certainly a perk, I wish to make it clear that the burn community was, and still is, “home” to me. Therefore, I write this thesis not only for my Musicology degree, or for the sake of sound studies scholarship, but also for the pleasure of the burn community. As such, the tone of my prose attempts to appeal to the widest audience.
History of Burns
Burning Man is an annual event—a “burn”—that occurs over the week leading up
to and including Labor Day in Black Rock City, Nevada. Black Rock City is an ephemeral city in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert that only exists for a fraction of the year, during the time that Burning Man is being built, taking place, and deconstructed.18

Burning Man is aptly named and known for its culminating event of the week: the burning man.19 On the penultimate night of the event, a giant wooden man is burned at the center of the festival. This ritual means something different to everyone and has never been defined.
As most Burning Man historical studies, documentaries, and articles explain, Burning Man began in 1986, “when Larry Harvey and Jerry James built an eight-foot effigy and incinerated it at sundown on summer solstice at San Francisco’s Baker Beach” (Gilmore and Van Proyen 2005, 6). The small group who had come to witness the burning of the man was supplemented by passer-bys on the beach, for a grand total of twenty-some participants. The group agreed that the event was a success and vowed to repeat it the following year. Each subsequent year from 1987 to 1990 the man and the group grew considerably, until in 1990, both had become so large that the federal park police intervened and asserted that the man could not be burned.20 It was at that time that several members of San Francisco’s Cacophony Society suggested that Harvey relocate
                                                      
of about two months (Burning Man Project 2017e). In 2016, “The Golden Spike” ceremony (in which DPW proclaims that the Black Rock Desert is now Black Rock City) commenced on July 28, 2016. The final day of DPW activity, entitled “we have to go home now,” is on October 5, 2016. The 2015 DPW handbook contained a timeline of similar length.
19 The event was officially dubbed “Burning Man” by Harvey for the 1988 event.
20 Journalist Jenny Kane (2015) reports that in 1987 the man was fifteen feet tall and approximately eighty people were in attendance. In 1988 the man was thirty feet tall and approximately 200 people were in attendance. In 1989 the man was forty feet tall and approximately 300 people were in attendance. In 1990 the man was again forty feet
tall, but the crowd ballooned to 800 participants.

the burning of the man to the Black Rock Desert.21 A “Zone Trip” was organized for Labor Day weekend of that same year, marking the collaboration of The Cacophony Society and Harvey’s crew.22 The man was deconstructed and loaded onto a rental truck, along with many of the eighty participants’ camping gear. The group caravanned deep into the Black Rock Desert and for a weekend camped, watched “desert videos on a big screen,” hosted a “semi-formal evening cocktail party with music,” during which participants were encouraged to bring their favorite CDs, visited “natural local hot springs,” engaged in “other activities as [they made] them up,” and burned the man (Doherty 2006, 50). With the exception of 1997, Burning Man has been held over Labor Day weekend in the Black Rock Desert, also known as “the playa” ever since.23 With every year, the complexity and breadth of Burning Man has increased, from what it takes to organize Burning Man, to the types of activities that happen there. In 1992, the Bureau
                                                      
21 As its newsletter states, The Cacophony Society, formed in 1986, “is a randomly gathered network of individuals united in the pursuit of experiences beyond the pale of mainstream society through subversion, pranks, art, fringe explorations and meaningless madness” (The Cacophony Society 2017). The Cacophony Society first discovered Harvey’s Burning Man in 1987 and in 1990 helped construct the man in a downtown San Francisco parking lot. Doherty (2006) gives a detailed account of the origin and expansion of Burning Man, going further back than The Cacophony Society to include its predecessor, The Suicide Club.
22 John Law (2016) writes that Zone Trips were conceived by Cacophonist Carrie Galbraith. “Taken from her interest in the films of Andre Tarkovsky and novels of Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, The Zone concept was that a person or group could enter into both a physical and a metaphysical space separate from daily “normal” existence, where literally anything could happen.” The Zone Trip in the Black Rock Desert was the fourth Cacophony Society sponsored Zone Trip.
23 Burning Man 1997 was relocated to the nearby Hualapai flat and the Fly Ranch. It moved back to the Black Rock Desert in 1998, where it has since stayed. Burners refer to it as the “playa,” known as such because the desert is actually a prehistoric lake bed of the former Lake Lahontan.

of Land Management (BLM) required a recreation permit and mandated that within a week post-event “no trace of the burning ceremony or the camp site can be found” (Burning Man Project 2017a).24 That same year, Michael Mikel and Rob Schmidt began the Black Rock Rangers, the first fire-spinners of Burning Man lit the man aflame, and the first rave camp was constructed a mile from center camp.25 1996 marked the first year in which Burning Man revolved around a central theme.26 By 1997, the population had swelled to 10,000 participants, a registered list of theme camps and events was published, art installations “increased four-fold the numbers of the previous year,” and for the first time, Black Rock City’s layout was designed by event coordinators (Burning Man Project 2017b). Furthermore, “following the 1997 Burn, the pilot regional program began, though modestly, as with all things Burning Man. Initially, only a handful of regions were represented: Austin, the North Bay, and, believe it or not, the entire country of Canada” (Burning Man Project 2017f).27 By 1998, “Burning Man-inspired events
                                                      
24 This mandate is important, for it marks the beginning of one of Burning Man’s “ten principles”: Leave No Trace.
25 The Black Rock Rangers website describes rangers as “participants who volunteer a portion of their time at [burns] in service of the safety and well-being of the [burn] community. Rangers act as non-confrontational community mediators, providers of reliable information, [and] facilitators of public safety” (Black Rock City, LLC. 2017).
26 1996 was a pivotal year for Burning Man. Its popularity had become so large that the city’s lack of fence, city plan, and rules became a problem. General chaos ensued. Participants were entering without tickets, setting off guns, explosives and fires, and driving all over, resulting in accidental injuries and death. It was then that the founders had a falling out. Some, such as John Law, believed that the event had gotten too big and needed to end. Others concluded that the event should continue, but that it needed more structure.
27 However, Bowditch describes the beginning of regionals a little differently.
She states that “LLC board members Goodell and Dubois started the Regional Network
  
12
were organized, far from Black Rock City and the Bay Area” (Ibid.). Rachel Bowditch describes:
As participants returned to their destinations of origin and attempted to keep the Burning Man spirit and ethos alive by organizing events in a similar vein, they began to return to the main organizers to ask for guidance with building a successful infrastructure to run and manage large events in the spirit of Burning Man. In response, the Burning Man Regional Network was formed (2010, 312).
With the help of the Burning Man Organization (BMO), these regional “collectivities introduce and adapt Burning Man’s organizational form and practices to other localities” (Chen 2011, 94). Dozens of these regional burns now occur on five continents and more are added to the list every year.28 In comparison to Burning Man which had 67,564 participants in 2015 and covered approximately seven square miles, regional burns are significantly smaller. Average regionals have anywhere between several hundred and several thousand participants; one can easily traverse around the entire burn. However, re-creating “the big burn” was never the intent of establishing the regional network.29 As the Burning Man diaspora continued to grow and spread, Harvey said that the “BMO’s
                                                      
Programme in 1997 when the BLM and Washoe Country officials confiscated all of the admission money collected that year, claiming it as tax. With the BMO in the red and on the verge of collapse, the community reached out to the Organization to ask how it could help save it from financial ruin” (2010, 309).
28 Katherine Chen cites that there are “over 100 regionals spread across five continents” (2011, 97). However, as this claim is dated and I am unsure of what she considered a “regional,” I am only including the multi-day regional burns that I was able to find online.
29 Regional burns are “bound by contract not to reproduce Black Rock City exactly. The events can celebrate the ten principles of Black Rock City and even burn an effigy, but it cannot have the same design as Harvey’s and the event cannot be called ‘Burning Man’” (Bowditch 2010, 315).
 
 13
role was clear: it needed to become a leader in the community and assist the regional groups as they tried to find their own identities” (Bowditch 2010, 312). Other Burning Man founders agreed on the importance of the regional network: “Burning Man is not infinite, it isn’t going to go on forever,” says Harley Dubois. “That is why investing in the outreach is so important” (Ibid., 322). Because of their numerous and differing locations, as well as cheaper ticketing and travel costs, regional burns provide access to a wider range of people. For these reasons, “local events are the primary ways that many around the country [and other countries] experience this alternative subculture” (Schmidt 2012, 2). Though regional burns differ from each other and the big burn in location and size, they are all united in the Burning Man ethos, a topic that will be discussed in the following section. In my thesis I will be focusing on seven specific regional burns— Wickerman (PA), Firefly (VT), Transformus (NC), POrtalburn (NY), Playa Del Fuego (DE), Alchemy (GA), and Frostburn (WV).30
What Happens at Burns?
“Burning Man, that’s like, the music festival out in Nevada, right?” “Burning
Man... isn’t that where people run around naked and do drugs in the desert for a week?” “Wait... so if there isn’t any hired entertainment, what do people actually do there?” As a burner and a researcher of burns, I get asked these kinds of questions—a lot. I always smile wide and take a deep breath, because frankly, a burn isn’t the easiest concept to explain, and when the media attempts to, more often than not it misses the point. “Since the mid 1990s, Burning Man has received considerable media coverage, although little of

spirit of the burn and for all intents and purposes are regional burns.

it has increased the public’s knowledge about the significance and complexity of the event” (Hockett 2005, 66). But that’s not necessarily the media’s fault. As Erik Davis states, “Black Rock cliché has it that you can’t say anything very penetrating about Burning Man because its diversity and contradictions undermine any generalization you might be tempted to make” (2005, 15). So no, a burn is not a music festival. Yes, people do go naked, and yes, there are drugs there, but it’s not the clichéd, stereotypical “countercultural spectacle” that the media portrays (Ibid.).31 And there is always so much to do there! In this section, I provide an overview of what actually happens at a burn; knowledge key to contextualizing the remainder of my study.
Through participant observation and discussions with burners, I have come to understand burns as radical experiments in temporary alternate societies. At each of these events, participants build an ephemeral city, provide their own food, water, and shelter, and schedule their own entertainment and activities, whatever they can possibly dream up. Unlike BMO, which now has a paid year-round staff, regionals are volunteer run—from the board of directors “BoD” (who deal with the behind-the-scenes legalities, insurance, and paperwork) to the pre-burn planning committees (such as ticketing, purchasing, art grants, placement, etc.) to the on-site coordination teams (such as the Department of Public Works (DPW), Gate, Parking, Rangers, and Sanctuary).32
                                                      
31 Additionally, Sarah Megan Heller (2013) discusses going naked and intoxication, albeit through alcohol, in her dissertation on adult play and transformation at Burning Man.
32 Sanctuary, also known by other names, is a safe place for overwhelmed participants to go, staffed by volunteers twenty-four hours a day. The amount of on-site coordination teams depends on the size of the burn. For example, in 2016, larger regional
burn Transformus, with it’s 2,500 participants, had upwards of thirty-six different

Attendees of burns (known as “burners”) can camp individually in designated open camping areas, or in a reserved area with a theme camp, a pre- planned group of people camping together with a
collective mission to provide a
unique service or environment to the community. Some theme camps offer gifts of food or beverages, while others may simulate a fantasy environment or provide music and/or space for dancing, fire-spinning, relaxation, or learning.33 (See Figure 1.) Elaborate theme camps combine many or all of
these elements. Events are usually hosted by theme camps, but occasionally individual campers as well, and are typically published in an event booklet, such as Frostburn’s WhatWhereWhen or Transformus’ BurnThisBooklet. Sometimes, theme camps post daily events on boards by their entryways. Events are limitless and include everything from seminars and group discussions, classes (such as yoga, aikido, or fire-spinning), to food and drink give-aways, to art and music making, to pageants and performances, to
                                                      
volunteer teams (Transformus 2017c), while smaller regional burn Frostburn, with its 300-some participants, had seven (Frostburn 2017).

late-night dance parties, and more.34 What most characterizes the burn atmosphere is an overall sense of play, ritual, and community; no doubt leftover influences from Harvey’s ritualized burning combined with the Cacophony Society’s playful pranks (see Doherty 2006).
Placed art is another key part of burn landscapes and soundscapes. “Artists utilizing all kinds of materials and media—including fire, sculpture, painting, light, electronic installation and performance—participate at the event[s]. Many of the artworks are site specific, and some are temporary, burned at the end of the event[s]” (Brill 2007, 342). However, the quantity and scope of art at regional burns depends on the amount of art grants available, as well as what participants are able to conceive, build, and transport to the burn.
Woven into the way of life at all burns are the “ten principles,” which were “written by [Burning Man founder] Larry Harvey in 2004 as a model of what had emerged in the desert and as a model for guiding the culture as it spreads to regional communities throughout the world” (Heller 2013, 22). (See Figure 2.) In other words, the ten principles both reflect the ethos of burner attitudes and guide behavior. For example, “gifting,” one of the ten principles, signifies that nothing can be bought, sold,

bartered, or exchanged at a burn.35 Another principle, “radical self-reliance,” entails that participants are responsible for providing all of their own required resources, from shelter, food, water (drinking, washing, and bathing), clothing, toiletry items, and cooking gear. “Leaving no trace” means that everything brought into the site must be brought back out, including dirty dish/shower water and trash. Before departing, participants are asked to do a “MOOP sweep” of their campsite to pick up small bits of litter, including everything from wood bits, nail clippings, sequins, bottle caps, and cigarette butts.36 “Communal effort” and “participation” work together to illustrate how burn culture values collaborative efforts, active involvement, and volunteerism. In accordance with these two principles, burns are “do-ocracys” and “no spectator” events in which participants are encouraged to choose roles and tasks for themselves and execute them and to engage in the burn society. “Communal effort” and “participation” are especially important at regional burns, at which no-one is paid, given “comped” tickets, or special accommodations. The Burning Man website and Chen (2011) cite that 2,000 participants volunteer at Burning Man, approximately three percent of its total population. In contrast, roughly thirty-five percent of the population volunteered at Transformus 2016 and sixty-one percent volunteered at POrtalburn 2016.37 The frequently tacked-on eleventh principle, “consent,” states that consent must be clearly
                                                      
35 Some burns, such as Burning Man, Playa Del Fuego, and Wickerman allow the sale of limited non-profit items, such as ice, on site.
36 MOOP stands for “matter out of place,” also known as litter.

granted from an individual who is clearly in control of their faculties enough to grant it, even for something as simple as a hug or an offer of a drink. A saying I heard often in my participation observation is that “the ten principles are descriptive, not prescriptive,” meaning that they were meant to describe the essence of burn culture, not authoritatively dictate one’s experience or to be used as a grading report. However, the ten principles also serve as a kind of social capital within the burn community. For instance, a theme camp’s lack of disrespect for “leave no trace” may land them a worse placement the following year, or a participant who does not bring sufficient shelter, food, or water, (therefore not abiding “radical self-reliance”) may be ridiculed by the community and called a “sparkle pony.”38
Regional burns vary in length, but generally last from a Thursday to a Monday, with limited early entry (for coordination teams, large theme camps, and art installations) beginning a few days before general admission. As the week and weekend progresses,
     Figure 2. The Ten Principles of Burning Man written by Larry Harvey in 2004
Radical Inclusion
Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.
Gifting
Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.
                                                         
38 In an ePLAYA thread, Savannah (2011) explains that “A sparkle pony is a Burner who is under-prepared for basic survival but still managed to pack 2 suitcases full of fabulous outfits. He or she expects the community to take up the slack because they’re just so wonderful and drama inevitably follows when expectations are not met. Although the word dates back to at least 2008, it was popularized by the "Sparkle Pony Corral," a theme camp present in Black Rock City from 2009-2010. Frustrated participants could drop off their camp’s sparkle ponies at the corral where they would be fed, watered, and have their egos stroked by “certifiable experts.” Sparkle ponies received much-needed attention while campmates received a much-needed break.”

     Decommodification
In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.
Radical Self-reliance
Burning Man encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.
Radical Self-expression
Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.
Communal Effort
Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.
Civic Responsibility
We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.
Leaving No Trace
Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.
Participation
Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.
Immediacy
Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.
   the city grows bigger, louder, and more vibrant with the arrival of participants and the construction of art and theme camps. It reaches its apex on Saturday night when the effigy (“the man” at Burning Man) is ritualistically burned and participants revel into the following dawn.39 Sunday’s vibe varies by regional burn, but generally involves calmer
                                                      
39 Effigies are built in various shapes and are not always a man. For example, Firefly (VT) burns “the bug” effigy every year, while Playa Del Fuego (DE) burns “the pony.” Other regionals do not specify a recurring theme for their effigies, such is the
  
20
activities, packing up, and frequently a temple and/or art burn that signifies healing, reflection, and departure.40 By Monday afternoon, all but essential volunteers have exited the property.
Theoretical Framework
But why study Burning Man culture? In the last ten to fifteen years, there has
been a surge in Burning Man-related media coverage, as well as artistic and academic publications. Some aim to explain what the event is like through photographic albums, documentaries, or ethnographic and historical writings (Burning Man 2017c). As the Burning Man community continues to prevail as a popular subculture (a conundrum in its own right), scholars from many disciplines have flocked to the event attempting to unpack its distinct subculture. Of the research published analyzing Burning Man, certain topics have been more frequently studied than others. The most common themes are how art (Brill 2016, 2007, and 2003; Kristen 2007 and 2003), performance (Bowditch 2013, 2010, and 2007; Clupper 2007), culture (Chen 2012a; Heller 2013; Hockett 2005; Kehoe 2011; Quaak 2017); ritual (Bowditch 2013, 2010, and 2007), religion and spirituality (Gilmore 2010 and 2005; Morehead 2013, 2011, and 2010; Pike 2010, 2005, and 2001), marketing and consumer culture (Kozinets and Sherry Jr. 2007a, 2007b, 2005, 2003a, 2003b, 2002a, 2002b), and organization and management (Chen 2012b, 2011, 2009, and 2005) function at Burning Man. Studies of burns have been sought after by both the

Burning Man and the academic community, for they are crucial to understanding modern counter-culture and contribute to the greater cultural knowledge about our time.41 As burners will excitedly explain, “Burning Man has become a social movement, a cultural force whose octopoid mimetic reach is immeasurable” (Burning Man Project 2017f). Burning Man fanatics and academics examine the possibilities that Burning Man culture has for application in a wider context, such as Chen’s work on volunteerism. Others, such as Harvey and Bowditch, have noted how the Burning Man ethos “physically resonate[s] throughout many levels of US culture, both consciously and unconsciously, creating new paradigms of performance, installation art, community and ritual— reawakening an avant-garde spirit in the twenty-first century” (Chen 2010, 325). Given Burning Man’s expansion, the founders’ high regard for the regional network (as discussed in the previous section), and the regionals’ nearly twenty years of existence, it is surprising that there is very little academic writing dedicated to the regional network.42 It is not that the regionals are completely overlooked in the scholarship, but rather that
                                                      
41 A listing of known academic writings published about Burning Man can be found in the philosophical center of the Burning Man website, http://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/academics/. Additionally, librarian Lauren Christos (2017) has created a guide that “consolidates various formats of information either created by the academic community of Burning Man or publications created by the Burning Man Organization.” It also lists “interviews, documentaries, DVD’s and other worthy items.” http://libguides.fiu.edu/burning_man.
42 Save for Chen’s (2011) work on how the Burning Man organizations disseminates its creativity practices to localities, I have only found one thesis (Schmidt 2012) that places regionals at its center. Another dissertation was published by Amy Swan (2013) in which she investigates how and if the ten principles are applied to a wider range outside of Black Rock City. However, she does not attend the regional events, but rather talks with burners about how they “practice[d] what they experienced in Black Rock City in their home communities, and through regional groups” (2013, 1).

their existence is implied as “miniaturized facsimiles of the Big Burn” (Schmidt 2012, 4). In his thesis, “’Welcome Home!’: Engendering Community Through Performance and Play at the Euphoria and Scorched Nuts Regional Burns,” Bryan Schmidt suggests that there are three reasons why regionals have been treated as such in Burning Man’s “academic conversation”:
First, their relatively small populations and genealogical link to Burning Man may lead many to assume that they are simply feeble attempts at recreating the spectacle of their namesake—a proverbial poor man's Burning Man. [Regional] Burns also lack the significant media output of their forerunner [...and] as a result, currently fly below the radar of a general public, as did Burning Man before its population swelled into the tens of thousands in the mid-1990s. Second, omitting regional Burns from the analysis of Burning Man fits into a pervasive narrative throughout theatre and performance history that prioritizes centralized or large-scale events—those with cultural currency on a national or global level—over smaller, community-centered activities. This trend tends to reify existing structural paradigms in a capitalist system by glorifying entities that succeed financially or achieve public fame. [...] Third, as one regional Burn organizer noted in an e-mail conversation with me, without the significant cultural capital of Burning Man, [regional] Burns have the reputation of being “just a party,” devoid of any meaning deeper than a bunch of people drinking, taking drugs, getting naked, and letting off steam. Thus, there exists the troubling possibility that those who are aware of regional Burns dismiss them as culturally insignificant (2012, 4).
As Schmidt explains, the above claims about regional burns are unfounded. Instead he shows how regional burns “are cultural activities in their own right that encourage an inimitable style of human interconnectedness based on each locality’s unique landscape and flavor” (Ibid., 4-5). Even before discovering Schmidt’s thesis, or any scholarship on Burning Man for that matter, I knew that regional burns were worthy of study, for it was my own prior experiences at Transformus and Frostburn that inspired this work. My burn experiences, both before and for my research, have solely occurred within the
regional network; yet I feel as strongly transformed, connected, and immersed by my
 
23
experiences as my peers and research participations who have gone to “TTITD” (burn lingo for “that thing in the desert.”) My participant observation research, like Schmidt’s, aims to contribute and broaden scholarship on Burning Man.
Interestingly in Burning Man literature, I have noticed a similar pattern regarding Burning Man’s sounds and by sounds I include noise, sound-art, and music. The sounds of Burning Man are implied; an inevitable background, meant to enhance the reader’s imagination of the event. Take a look at the following passage, typical of the way sound is integrated into discussion of Burning Man:
You stand straddling your bike, watching other people work. It is cold out there in the middle of the desert, but you somehow feel soothed by the loud hum of the generators, the high-pitched whine of the lights, and the occasional staccato of a nail gun (Heller 2013, 156).
Clearly the noise of the event is an important quality of Heller's experience at the burn. Not only has she gone out of her way to include the sounds of the burn, (in a dissertation that has very little to do specifically with sounds), but also she has also included how those sounds make her feel. I have found sound descriptors especially prominent in ethnographic writings on Burning Man and in descriptions of Burning Man art installations, even for the art pieces that are not centered on sound itself. For example, in his artist statement for “Lotus-Land,” Paul Cesewski describes the crowd’s reaction to his massive, steel “fire-spewing” lilies:
During the Burning Man event, the sudden blast of the propane fire cannons would startle event-goers. Often, the valves would stick open after the blast, catching the flowers on fire. We would yell, “Kick it!” People had to race from flower to flower, kicking the stems, in an unexpected game of flower soccer (2007, 340).
In another artist statement from that same year, Larry Breed describes his twenty foot-tall
 
24
perpetual-motion flaming tetherball clock, an invention called “The Chaotick”: “The arm’s tip, as it completes the seventy-foot circular trip, clangs against the fixed pole. The balls spirals inward, finally banging the pole and abruptly starting its unwind: one tick of playa time” (Breed 2007, 341). The sound of the flaming tetherball clanking on the pole thus served as a marker of time for participants.
Although “visuality is without question the dominant paradigm [of Burning Man art pieces], for the most part the traditional terms of single media do not apply” (Moore, Ogawa, and Smallwood 2011). Art that incorporates aural aspects, known as sound-art, has long been valued in burn culture. For example, Burning Man 1998 gave an art grant to Aaron Wolf Baum’s sound-art piece “The Nebulous Entity,” a mobile sculpture/performance piece meant to look like “the nerve center of an alien civilization.” Its sound system ran off of a laptop computer that contained over 500 sound-clips of human culture, including commercials, jingles, babies crying, people talking, car horns, etcetera. It also was programmed to collect sound-clips from its environment through a microphone, incorporating these new sounds with the pre-recorded clips. “Its installed software continuously generated fractal waveforms and used them to layer randomly selected samples, playing them at varying speeds, forward and backward, and at multiple times” twenty-four hours a day, “giving rise to moments of great serendipity” (Wolf Baum 2003, 350). In my participant observation, sound-art was one of the facets of the burn experience that caught my attention. Upon returning from my first research burn, I wrote:
One thought that's been going around and around in my head since Wickerman is honing in on the sound-art of Burning Man events. It's the ways in which burners manipulate art and sound that really struck me at
 
25
Wickerman. For instance, one artist, Knagi, brought pitched laser fire poofers that either sounded when someone touched the corresponding laser or when he initiated a programmed song. (See Figure 3.)43
  Figure 3. Knagi Saki’s “Laser Harp Fire Calliope,” laser scale organized from right to left. Fire poofers in a semicircle. Photograph by Redlite Photography.
Yet very few authors have considered Burning Man’s sound worthy of focus; of the writing that does exist, sound-art comprises some of it (Moore and Smallwood 2013; Moore, Ogawa, and Smallwood 2011). Music-wise, Graham St. John’s (2017, 2014, and 2009b) work on the electronic dance
music (EDM) culture at Burning Man seems to be the only academic writing on music at Burning Man, thus leaving the remainder of music at burns unexplored. When I explained this oversight in the scholarship to burners, most seemed very surprised; the noise and music present plays such an integral—even pervasive and unrelenting—part of their experience. “Music and sound are such a huge part of what makes each camp their own,” Jilly explains. “I'll gravitate toward certain camps or installations or neighborhoods based on how their sound draws me in and depending on what chemical mood I’m in.”44 I wondered if perhaps the reason why these topics have been overlooked

is because how one hears, listens, or subconsciously uses sound is not easy to describe.
In “The Soundscape of Burning Man” (2011), the only article thus far on noise at burns and one of the major inspirations for my project, authors Moore and Smallwood attempt to analyze Burning Man’s sounds. In it, they list nine primary features of the Burning Man soundscape: “amplified music, fireworks, air horns, bursts of flame from a variety of jets and cannons, large fires, megaphones, gasoline-powered generators, bicycle-related sounds, people talking, laughing.” They note that though “it is difficult to characterize the soundscape of Burning Man, [...] the soundscape, more than any other sensory experience, communicates the massive size and diversity of the city, as well as the passion and energetic celebration of its inhabitants” (2011, 48). Using their on-site observations from Burning Man, the authors give examples of how the soundscape organizes the event as a map, as a clock, and as a calendar. While the article offers several exciting points, it is just four and a half pages long, including photos and a map of Burning Man’s layout, thus inviting further and more extensive study. My research aims to expand upon their research by way of ethnography, connecting my personal experiences of regional burns and their soundscapes to interviews, sound-clips, and themes in sound studies.

CHAPTER TWO
METHODS
Initial Intentions and Pros of Studying Regional Burns
I admit that my original idea was not to travel to seven different regional burns, though I am very glad it turned out that way. Initially, my plan was to continue Moore and Smallwood’s work by driving out to “TTITD” to identify, record, describe, and taxonomically organize Burning Man’s idiosyncratic soundscape. Now, anyone reading this that has been to Burning Man (and I hadn’t) is laughing right now. Why? Because Black Rock City is the size of downtown San Francisco and has as much going on in it as downtown San Francisco (Pleasance 2015). As a single researcher, with a single recorder, there was no way that I was going to be able to capture even a smidgen of Burning Man’s soundscape. As a Burning Man virgin (albeit not a burn virgin), there was no way that I could have possibly prepared myself (and my recording equipment) for the extreme weather conditions that Burning Man presents, such as white-out dust storms, high winds, unbearably hot and freezing temperatures, and rain (Burning Man Project 2017j). Furthermore, without having any prior experience at (or recordings of) Burning Man, I would have had nothing to compare my observations and recordings to. Finally, going to Burning Man is expensive. In my discussions with burners, they reported that it costs approximately $1500-3000 to attend Burning Man.45 I applied for a grant and was
                                                      
45 In contrast, burners reported that it costs them approximately $400 to attend a regional burn. However, they also indicated that purchasing initial camping equipment or funding an art/gifting project can add significantly more. Furthermore, it takes a considerable amount of time to plan for and attend a burn, a luxury that people in working-class backgrounds may not be able to afford. All burns are a financial and time
28
investment and thus participants with greater socio-economic privileges may find them
  
denied; that was definitely for the better. Instead I focused my efforts on researching regional burns on the East-coast. In the end, I decided to attend eight regionals: Wickerman (PA), Firefly (VT), Transformus (NC), POrtalburn (NY), Playa Del Fuego (DE), Alchemy (GA), Love Burn (FL), and Frostburn (WV). (See Table 1.) Love Burn

   was ultimately dropped from my study due to distance, time, and money, for a total of seven burns. I picked these specific regionals for a few reasons. First, I was limited by time and wanted to complete the vast majority of my fieldwork between June and November. All but one, Frostburn, occurred within this time-frame. Second, I wanted to limit myself to places I could drive to in a reasonable amount of time by myself. All of the regionals were within (a very long) day’s drive. Third, I wanted to attend regionals that were geographically different from one another; different enough that I could experience burns in a variety of natural environments. I was curious to see whether burns maintained aural tropes, regardless of their location, and also interested to see how differing environments effected burn soundscapes. Many of the problems that I would

29
have had trying to study sound at Burning Man were negated by choosing instead to attend the regionals. Because Burning Man only lasts for a week out of the year, any fieldwork accomplished there is very temporary. Burning Man scholars may attend Burning Man for multiple years prior to writing about it, waiting an entire year between fieldwork opportunities. Scholars that were only able to attend Burning Man once for their fieldwork, such as Kara Leeann Kehoe, note their difficulties attempting fieldwork in such a short-lived, large event. I had attended both Transformus and Frostburn twice before my fieldwork. The other regionals were new to me. Luckily, veteran regional burners (such as those who had been to Alchemy eight times or to Playa Del Fuego twenty times) were delighted to share with me their experiences of previous years, explaining in detail how this year compared to last year or years before. Because I was able to attend so many within a short time frame, I could more easily pick out the similarities and differences between the burns. Tropes became clear. The reasonable size of the regional burns also made it possible for me to walk loops of the property. In a single day, I was easily traversing the entire length of the burn ten or more times. I could visit every theme camp and attend a larger number of the events posted in the WhatWhereWhen booklets than I could have done at Burning Man. And I was able to connect with regional burn participants in a way that I most likely could not have done at the big burn. As Deena, one of my informants, notes:
Burning Man is amazing for the scale of the art, the immersiveness of the city, and the limitless possibilities for exploration and adventure, but the smaller burns are much better for forming connections and community. I had a lot of wonderful interactions with people at Burning Man, but they
 
30
 were definitely fleeting, whereas some of my dearest friends are people I met through regional burns.46
I saw the same people multiple times every day for the length of the burn, forming meaningful, lasting relationships in which burn participants trusted me as a fellow burner
and researcher. This trust transferred into the online social media burn community, where I posted information about my theme camp, “Thesis Camp,” and my research prior to each burn. (See Figure 4.) As evident by the comments in the Facebook post, the rapport I
had built with burn participants at Wickerman and Firefly carried into the online community for
Transformus. I had been vetted by the Wickerman and Firefly communities and therefore given credibility, even by people who had yet to meet me. Multiple times a day burners would stop me to introduce themselves and ask me about my project, citing that they had seen my Facebook post and wanted to know either more about it or ask how they could help. Furthermore, because of the proximity between the regional burns, I was able to

see many of the same burners from burn to burn. For example, one participant named Sheck and I saw each other at five out of the seven regional burns I attended. Not only was he an artist, touring his piece “The Tower of Not Babel,” but also he served on the BoD for POrtalburn. Our repeated interactions turned out to be very helpful; I was allowed to arrive on site a full day before POrtalburn participants arrived and permitted to leave multiple hours after everyone (but the BoD) had gone. By our fourth burn together, we were able to engage in deep and honest conversations. I have a feeling that this is the kind of confidence one is only able to make by spending repeated time with another person. Traveling to a variety of close-by regional burns provided me this opportunity in a relatively short amount of time.
Participant Observation Design
Thesis Camp
As a self-proclaimed burner, I felt torn by my desire to study burn culture. On the one hand, “radical inclusion” and “radical self-expression” meant that I, even as a researcher, was welcomed into the community. Even the Burning Man website notes that the organization “encourages academic projects by providing access to the Burning Man archives, photo and video passes on the playa, staff and participant interviews, and other forms of support for research and educational efforts” (Burning Man Project 2017d). On the other hand, however, I knew of the community’s clear “no spectators” policy and worried tirelessly about consent issues for recording audio. So, in the spirit of “participation” and “communal effort,” I came up with the idea to attend each burn as a
 
32
one-person theme camp, Thesis Camp.47 (The most blatantly apropos name I could think of.) I registered Thesis Camp with the placement team prior to Wickerman, Firefly, POrtalburn, PDF, and Alchemy.48 For those burns, Thesis Camp was reserved space and placed on the official burn map. I also submitted a description to the placement team that was displayed inside the WhatWhereWhen booklet. For example, the description for Thesis Camp in Alchemy’s “pocket guide” read:
What does a Burn sound like? What sounds are integral to the Burn atmosphere... regardless of where or when the Burn takes place? What can one learn about Burn culture by listening to what it sounds like? Curious? I am too. My name is Bexx! I'm an ethnomusicologist working on my Master's thesis about regional burn soundscapes. All weekend long I'll be out and about field recording in an effort to capture the sounds of Alchemy X. But I need your help! While I'm out, stop by the Thesis Camp tent (open 24/7). Inside the Thesis Camp tent, you can read more about what my project entails, leave me feedback, provide suggestions for what sounds you think I ought to get recorded, enter a raffle to win homemade cookies sent to your house, sign up for an interview, or just relax in the cuddle puddle with a snack.
At each burn, I set up two separate spaces: the Thesis Camp tent and my own private canvas tent, complete with kitchen, desk, and sleeping area. I also brought a small generator, which I stored under a ten-foot by ten-foot EZ-up canopy at half height,
                                                      
47 Thesis Camp in its current design, with a single person running it, would not have been possible or effective at Burning Man.
48 Instead of registering Thesis Camp with the placement team at Transformus, I advertised it as an on-going event. At Transformus, the Thesis Camp tent was located within Phart Camp, the larger theme camp for which I am TCO. The only burn in which I did not advertise Thesis Camp was Frostburn. Frostburn’s typically harsh weather conditions (freezing temperatures, high winds, and snow) would have precluded me from setting up the Thesis Camp structure and would have been a nightmare for my technology. Furthermore, by then I had collected an overwhelming amount of data. Instead while I was there, I fully immersed myself in the environment and focused on
being present during my participant observation.
  
33
 consuming challenge. I took extra care to decorate Thesis Camp to make it feel welcoming and cozy. Thesis
Camp, essentially just a ten-foot by twenty-foot tent, would be competing for attention alongside larger, more elaborate theme camps. When possible I applied for early entry to the burns, which usually began a day or two before the gate officially opened. That way I could spend the time I needed to get set up before most participants arrived, familiarize myself with the property, and take a few sound-clips of the natural environment.49 In the entrance way of Thesis Camp, I posted a brief explanation of Thesis Camp’s purpose and also left a description of what I looked like and what I was wearing that day.
(Participants often found me later and introduced themselves, citing that they had recognized me from my description.) On the left hand side of Thesis Camp was a table

to power lights and my electronics. Although I was accustomed to setting up fairly complex theme camp structures, a result of my involvement with “Phart Camp,” erecting Thesis Camp by myself proved to be a time

and chairs and on the right hand side was a comfortable place on the floor with blankets and pillows (known as a “cuddle puddle”). On the table were three binders that participants could read or write in. The first binder contained a document that outlined my (initial) research objectives, hypothesis, rationale and significance, resources, study

the third binder, participants had the option to leave me their contact information, demographics, and sign
up for a potential interview. Participants could choose to leave me a comment card in my “comment card mailbox.” (Some of which remarked on the appealing decorations and thanked me for a peaceful place to relax or “trip.”)51 In the spirit of “gifting,” visitors of Thesis Camp could take a treat from the sweets jar and sign up for a raffle to win home-
                                                      
50 Although the Temple University IRB ultimately deemed my thesis project “not applicable,” I still felt it necessary to follow similar guidelines for ethical human subjects research.
51 “Tripping” is being under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, such as LSD or
design, and more.50 The second binder left a space for participants to leave me suggestions for sounds they thought were important to the burn “soundmosphere” (as I called it; a play on the word “atmosphere”). In

baked cookies sent to their house after the burn. While these types of edible gifts were gladly accepted, I was reassured by participants that my gift to the community was the
research itself and that their participation in my research was a gift to me. However, I did have ulterior motives for the raffle—it helped me to estimate how many people visited Thesis Camp over the course of the burn. From talking to Thesis Camp visitors, I gathered that visitors entered the raffle even if they did not leave a comment or suggestion. A few times each day, I checked the sound
suggestion binder and comment cards in Thesis Camp. Often times, someone would leave me a suggestion for an event or sound to attend or capture that day. However, in an effort to not hover and affect data collection there, I generally steered clear of Thesis Camp.
Daily Routine
Once Thesis Camp and my temporary home were set up, I spent the vast majority of my time out and about the burn observing, participating, and recording sounds. I typically woke up around eight thirty to nine A.M. (unless there was an event earlier, like yoga), got dressed, ate breakfast, checked the event booklet, packed a backpack with everything I would need until mid afternoon (including my cup, plate, utensils, headlamp, extra batteries, extra microphones, pens, sunscreen, lip balm, protein bars, water, the WhatWhereWhen booklet, etc.), ran a microphone check, and wrote or dictated any

missed field notes before venturing out.52 Inside the fanny pack at my hip fit my Zoom H6 recorder and my notebook, both of which I was constantly reaching for. I tried, as best as I could, to both observe and aurally capture as much of the burns as possible. All day, every day, I walked loops of each event’s grounds, attending events, talking to and informally interviewing participants, taking pictures to supplement my audio recordings, and engaging in my environment. I generally stopped back at Thesis Camp for meals, at which time I also wrote or recorded extended field notes, and/or changed into warmer nighttime clothing. Throughout the late evening, where applicable, I periodically returned to check the gasoline levels on my generator.53 Sleep was few and far between. The burn never sleeps; there is always something to do, to see, to miss. Though as I discovered, and as my recordings reflect, the times when energy levels lulled stayed consistent from burn to burn. I used these hours, as most burners did, to eat and to rest. I was exhausted, but I was also exhilarated. The final day of the burn (Monday) was usually the hardest. By then, I was dirty, sore, sleep deprived, and homesick. The excitement and new-ness of the burn had worn off and I was eager for a long shower, a fresh hot meal, and a comfortable bed. But at each burn, Thesis Camp was one of the last to pack up and leave. I intentionally waited, watched, walked, and listened. My final activity consisted of a sound walk around the grounds, in which each time I noticed the cyclical pattern of sound of the burn from start to finish.

53 From Thursday through Sunday I shared a generator with “Priority Five” at Wickerman, “Tottenkitten” at Firefly, and “The Prancing Pony” at POrtalburn, and so I did not need to check my generator levels. Instead, I contributed ten gallons of gasoline.

 Technology
The technology I chose to use was a Zoom H6 recorder and a pair of Sound Professionals Master Series Binaural microphones. The microphones are tiny and almost look like Bluetooth wrap-around-ear headphones. Binaural microphones are unique in that they rest inside the user’s pinnae—left and right—capturing an (almost jarring)

lifelike stereo recording. By placing “the mic element right next to the ear canal, well within the pinna, [what results is] the most realistic recording possible, from the perspective of the person wearing them”
(The Sound Professionals
2017).54 As their description suggests, I found them to be extremely effective in providing an accurate reflection of the
burn soundscape, especially for the price ($150 a pair). However, the extended use and exposure to sweat and elements proved to be too much for the microphones to handle. A pair (or two) broke every burn. At Wickerman I did not have a back-up pair and had to resort to taking recordings with the Zoom’s included MSH-6 microphone (a capsule that contains two mic elements, a unidirectional and a bi-directional mic). After this mistake,
                                                      
54 This particular brand was recommended to me by a fellow sound-catching enthusiast, a University of Pennsylvania professor who uses them to record city
 soundscapes.
 
38
I quickly sent the initial microphones back in for repair, purchased a second pair, and by the end of my research was even gifted a third pair from the seller. In spite of these difficulties, which caused undue stress at each burn, I am certain that I still would have chosen to use this technology. Because the microphones were in my ears and my recorder could be held in my fanny pack, I had free hands to write, climb, dance, or eat with, to make art, music, or craft with, or to use in any activity that made sense at the time. The free hands for writing were especially useful. In the Zoom H6, recordings can only be saved according to a chosen folder and a time stamp. In order to remember what the recordings were of later, I constantly was jotting down time stamps and a description in a little notebook. Each night (or early morning) when I retired to my tent, I transferred the recordings to my laptop. When I returned home from each burn, I reviewed my notebook and matched my descriptions up with the time stamps, renaming each recording as I listened.
Consent
My biggest concern of my study—by far—was making sure that I obtained the proper consent prior to and during my audio recordings. This was no easy feat. As burners will explain, consent regarding photography and videography is a sticky situation. Photography is an art form. Art is highly valued in the burn community. Photographers feel as though their art is a form of “radical self-expression” and “participation” in the burn community. However, if the photos are of a certain person, or a group of people, the question arises whether the photographer needs to ask for the consent of the people in the photo. Some say yes; others disagree. On the one hand,
burns are a place for self-exploration and “immediacy,” a place where “a person can
 
39
engage in playful experimentation, disconnected from ordinary social, cultural, and moral frameworks” (Heller 2013, 12-13). The playful atmosphere at a burn may incite “an individual to feel more creative in their behavioral repertoire and to become temporarily willing to step beyond those behaviors that have worked in the past to experiment with new ones and test them out” (Ibid., 7-8). A person who looks and acts completely in their element may, in reality, be trying out something new and unfamiliar and may not want their picture taken. On the other hand, asking for consent ruins the possibility of candid photography. Furthermore, there are often far too many people in the shot to ask for everyone’s permission. Burn participants value their individual agency. Should it be the subject’s choice whether or not their experience is documented? If so, does this take away from photographers’ agency? To help reconcile these differing opinions, some burns gift out “no photography” wristbands. These brightly colored bracelets indicate to photographers that under no circumstance is a picture to be taken with that person in it, even if they are just in the background.
Participants frequently engaged me in conversation about my audio consent practices, both online and at the burn. In an archetypal response to my Thesis Camp introduction on the Alchemy Facebook page, Rebecca commented “This sounds neat! Just please be careful about capturing people’s conversations without their consent.”55 Sound-clip 20 contains a conversation I had with two POrtalburn participants about audio consent practices.56 In it, one participant expresses his opinion that in order to capture

  authentic audio recordings, I should record first, then ask permission later. The other participant agrees, but with reservations, wondering where to “draw the line.” I approached the notion of consent carefully. Like a video, my sound-clips captured multiple minutes at a time. Often times, I was moving during the sound-clip, walking around the property and recording a changing soundscape.57 Even when standing still, people moved in and out of my microphones’ range.58 There was just no way that I could ask everyone within ear range for consent. At all times, I wore a bright neon index card in the center of my chest that explained that I could be recording audio samples. (See
  Figure 8. Audio consent sign. Photograph by author at PDF 2016.
Figure 8. This sign turned out to be a fantastic conversation starter. In many of my recordings, a person walks up to me and reads my sign aloud before engaging me in conversation about my project.) If I wanted to capture a people-oriented
sound (such as a yoga class, someone
ordering a drink at a bar, or a group conversation in a cuddle puddle), I would ask the person/group of people making the
sounds for consent before recording.59 For events, this meant that I tried to show up early

and talk to the person/people running it ahead of time; they would often make an announcement on my behalf. For in-the-moment occurrences, I recorded first then asked for consent afterwards, making it clear to the person/people involved that I would happily delete the recording if consent had been breached. I did not ask for consent when recording sound-walks, inanimate objects (such as sound-art and fire-poofers), impossibly large group settings, or live performances. More than anything, the key was to be hyper-aware of my surroundings at all times. If a situation was questionable, I always asked first. For example, at Alchemy I attended an event called “King Max’s Storytime Corner.” There, participants were asked to bring their favorite children’s books to read to the group. A participant, Hill, brought a book he wrote called Blue: A Mindfulness Tale. Before he began to read, I asked if I could record the story and I’m so glad I did. Hill consented, but with one stipulation: that I was not to post more than a consecutive minute of the audio. The book was about to be published and he did not want to preemptively release the full book to the public. In cases when I could not ask for consent, I gauged the mood and recorded only what I thought was appropriate. Although this resulted in a skewed perception of mood in the general timbre of my audio collection, it was a price I was willing to pay for the protection of burn participants’ privacy, as well as my reputation in the community. Trust was key. My microphones were always in my ears; my recorder was always at my hip. I wore a sign alerting participants to the fact that I could always be recording. Yet in tense, private, or off-the- record conversations, participants trusted that my equipment was actually off. I was not

perfect, but it was always on accident. I distinctly remember a panicked moment where audio consent was breached. It was Thursday morning at PDF and I was sleepily taking a morning sound-walk of the grounds. Gate had yet to open and the only people on site were team leads and DPW crew members. I stopped in the pavilion to grab a coffee and to see if any of the team leads needed assistance setting up. One team lead noted that they would need help in a few minute’s time. While I sat and waited with my coffee, I fiddled with my recorder, adjusting sound levels and taking decibel readings of the pavilion. Focused on my readings and also groggy from lack of sleep, I failed to notice the quiet but heated discussion that had begun to take place only a few feet from me. “Are you recording?” someone suddenly asked me. I jerked my head up, confused, wondering what I had missed. “No,” I knee-jerk replied, suddenly feeling horribly guilty and turning a bright shade of red. “Wait—is that even a question?” another burner chimed in. “You better not be recording without my consent.” My heart dropped and started beating rapidly, thudding loudly into my ears. I shut the recorder immediately off. I constantly worried about losing the trust of the community. I perpetually feared the possibility of being ostracized for my research. I thought of myself as being especially careful when it came to consent issues, yet here was a moment where I failed in consent. This experience made me wonder what else I might have accidentally recorded over the last four burns. As a result, I dropped a major intended goal of my research. I had planned on creating an interactive blog webpage in which to post my thesis, complete with a fully organized, unabridged collection of my recordings. After this encounter, I realized my design would need to be reworked. Still, in an effort to maintain consistent, I
continued in the manner of my original research goals (albeit extra careful). My two-
 
43
week non-stop tour to PDF and Alchemy was underway and I had already completed two thirds of my fieldwork burns in this manner. Although in the future I would like to create the web archive, the sound files are first going to require a lot of preparatory editing work.
Collected Audio Data
At the burns, I did not leave my recorder continuously running. While doing so would have resulted in a more accurate reflection of my time there, it also would have resulted in unnecessarily long recordings. Generally, I aimed for one to five minute recordings. Exceptions to this guideline included rituals (such as the burn or the temple), ongoing discussions, sound-walks, a task that I wanted recorded from start to finish (such as waiting in line for “White Dragon Noodle Bar’s” ramen), or particularly engrossing events (such as the Miss Firefly competition). For these longer recordings, I tried to mark the progression of events with their time stamps in my journal. But even with this strategy, my recordings were tedious and time consuming to sift through. When I returned home, I organized my sounds into the burn and day in which they occurred. I listened through all of them (skipping through the longer recordings) and named them based on the activities or conversations happening in each one. The recordings can be searched through by key word (in the title) or by the time in which they were recorded.
My fieldwork was a learning experience, especially when it came to technology. For example, after Transformus, I learned to record my final sound-walk of the property. As the “total hours recorded” column in “Table 3” shows, I progressively recorded more
 
44
each burn. Transformus was an outlier; it continuously rained on and off and both pairs of my binaural microphones broke. By Friday at Transformus, I made a decision to stop recording entirely. My constant worrying and frustration with technology was taking away from my fieldwork. Furthermore, the quality of the recordings increases with every burn. As time went on, I learned how the microphones and recorder handled various

  sounds and how to best capture them. Especially loud PA systems were the most difficult to record. In these clips, the sounds are garbled as if far away or under water.60
Although I ultimately decided not to post my collection of regional burn recordings, they were still crucial to the development of my thesis. I revisited them often for inspiration and as data to investigate my theories. My belief is that sound can deepen and enhance ones understanding of another culture. Throughout my thesis, I attempt to shake up academia’s visual-centric practices and thus include include these recordings to supplement my written ethnographic observations.

CHAPTER THREE AURAL SUBSTANCE Burn Sounds
Sound at a burn is constant, varied, overwhelming, and relentless. At all hours of the day, one can generally expect to hear a conglomerate of sounds including: weather and environment related natural sounds such as wind, rain, crickets, etc.; construction noises; live music including DJs, instrumental music, bands, and solo artists; automobile related noises such as the movement and honking of cars, golf-carts, and art cars; pre- recorded amplified music in a variety of genres, coming from a variety of places such as art-cars, portable speakers, and PA systems; people noises including talking, cheering, shouting, laughing, crying, howling, singing, snoring, jeering, instructing, clapping, and moaning; portable generators; task-oriented sounds such as cooking, cleaning, exercising, showering, dancing, art-making, etc.; megaphones; sound-art installations; fire-related sounds from bonfires, burn barrels, fire-spinning, flame-effects; and more. Though at first this wide, noisy soundscape may seem immense and completely random, Moore and Smallwood argue that it “harbors a wealth of information [...] that can be easily gleaned by an experienced citizen, some of which is available even to relative newcomers” (2011, 48). As mentioned in “Chapter One,” Feld developed a concept of sound “as a way of knowing place in and through the sonic environment,” or “acoustemology” (Eisenberg 2015, 198).
Acoustemology conjoins “acoustics” and “epistemology” to theorize sound as a way of knowing. In doing so it inquires into what is knowable, and how it becomes known, through sounding and listening. [...It] insists that one does not simply “acquire” knowledge but, rather, that one knows through an ongoing cumulative and interactive process of participation and reflection (Feld 2015, 12 and 13-14).
46
 
Acoustemology, then, is hearing and “listening as habitus” (Feld 2015, 18), to extend sociologist Pierre Bourdieu’s (1984, 170) term. Acoustemology assumes that “life is shared with others-in-relation, with numerous sources of action [...] that are variously human, nonhuman, living, nonliving, organic, or technological” (Feld 2015, 15).61
In Chapter Three, I employ Feld’s concept of acoustemology, participant observation, interviews with burners, and my burn recordings to back up and build upon Moore and Smallwood’s (2011) initial claims. Like Moore and Smallwood, I show how burn soundscapes signify the time, date, and location. I then convey how the sounds of a burn signify public and private spaces, and burners’ lived experience.
Time
Time at a burn is a peculiar concept. On the one hand, the time is of the upmost
importance to volunteers, who need to get to their shifts on time. It is also important— most of the time—for daily rituals and events. In the event booklets, activities are usually listed by the day and the time. For example, at Alchemy, “Sacred and Profane” hosted hour-long “smoke bath experiences,” at which burners could meditate to relaxing music inside a sauna-like room, filled with smoking herbs.62 A few of these smoke baths were scheduled each day, but rotated through different herbs, such as lavender, sage, mugwort, and rosemary. Additionally, baths were limited in space and were listed as
                                                      
61 I stipulate “in today’s modern world,” with people and technology sounds, in order to contrast R. Murray Schafer’s concept of “soundscape” as something merely ecological.
62 Sound-clip 27, “smoke bath experience” at “Sacred and Profane,” audio taken at Alchemy, October 15, 2016 at 2:17pm.
  
47
“women only,” “men only,” or non-specific. It took me multiple tries until I was finally able to attend one of the smoke baths because I kept losing track of the time and missed it, or was not able to attend because of the gender specifications.
On the other hand, time at a burn can seem inconsequential. Breed’s description of his flaming tetherball clock, “The Chaotick,” (introduced in the “Theoretical Framework” section) is a testament to the way in which burn time moves at a different pace to “default” time. “The Chaotick” marked the passing of time by its repetitive winding and un-winding pattern, “clang[ing] against the fixed pole” in the center. But the tetherball’s clang did not indicate traditional seconds or minutes. It did, however, clang to its own consistent unit of measurement—“playa time” (2007, 341). Burn life is so different from the “default-world” that time does not seem to really matter. There, you eat when you’re hungry, you sleep when you’re sleepy, and you basically do whatever you want to do (within reason), whenever you want to do it, embracing the principle of “immediacy” and living in moment. At burns, “burner time” is a common phrase that denotes the understanding amongst burners that all things at a burn generally happen a little bit later than expected. A breakfast event scheduled for ten A.M. may not actually get started until ten-thirty or eleven, or one burner might say to another “I’ll meet you there in about five burn minutes” which actually means it could be ten or fifteen. Event planners sometimes (though not always, as was the case at “Sacred and Profane”) take this into account. For example, on Friday night at Alchemy, I literally ran to a Shabbat service at “Camp One Nightstand.” Shabbat is the Jewish Sabbath, observed from Friday at sunset to Saturday at sunset each week. I was particularly concerned
about being late to this event because the precise time of sunset is important in Shabbat
 
48
rituals. But I needn’t have run; the event organizers had purposefully waited an extra fifteen minutes for late-comers like me to arrive on time.63 While events are usually scheduled for a period of multiple hours, allowing burners to come and go as they please, arriving late can mean missing out on the important beginning of an event (such as a seminar or a class), or an event altogether (as is the case with food give-aways). Other events may be postponed “until we feel like it” or cancelled entirely without warning.
Regardless of whether one thinks that time is or is not an important factor, time at a burn is cyclical and is reflected in the burn soundscape. As Moore and Smallwood point out, with a little bit of experience, anyone paying attention can use the soundscape as an approximate indicator of the time. The easiest aural time mark at regional burns is often the natural environment. (Unlike the Black Rock Desert, which Moore and Smallwood say has very few defining aural features.) During my interview with Andrew (see “Appendix A”), I played him a sound-clip from Firefly and asked him to comment on it. “Huh!” he replied. “I’m guessing that was a nighttime one that you took, in a field, maybe?” When I asked him how he knew that it was at night, he explained:
Listening to the ambient sounds of the forest. [...] No animal sounds. It was quiet. It sounded dark. That place was so alive with bugs and birds and whatever and [in the sound-clip] all of those were just silent... it was just the sound of the still night air and crickets.64

However, these natural environment indicators shift from burn to burn and sometimes, like during wintertime burns such as Frostburn, are less so a part of the burn soundscape.
Even without hints from the natural environment, the approximate time of day can be gleaned from a few other ways. As long time burner Pyrocelt explained:
The burn probably follows a more specific arc throughout the day, depending on how much activity is happening here or there. There’s kind of morning activities and afternoon buzzes and a funny lull before night where everyone is probably cooking before it gets all heated up again after dark and people are going until god knows when.65
This daily arc was something that I noticed during my participant observation as well. The general timbre of the soundscape adjusted throughout each day and at the beginning of a new twenty-four-hour period began all over again. The “funny lull” that Pyrocelt picked up on was generally between four to eight P.M. and again from four to eight A.M. (The times I used most for eating and resting, as described in the “Methods” section.) Certain types of activities were more common during the morning and afternoon hours, such as water related activities, like swimming in the lake at Transformus, the pond at POrtalburn, or the stream at Wickerman.66 Much of the time, the types of music available and the volume of the music coincided with the time of the day. The early morning hours between the hours of five to eight A.M. at regionals “coincide with a shift towards mellower, more ambient music, and the volume slowly decreases, though dance beats continue to be heard throughout the morning.” The late morning and afternoon

50
hours “contain a broader diversity of musical styles than the nighttime’s emphasis on dance music” (Moore and Smallwood 2011, 50). Around eight P.M. (or with the setting of the sun, whichever comes first), the volume turns up on the PA systems and the burn buzzes with activity. More generators turn on to help light up people’s campsites, excited burners emerge from their personal areas ready to engage in the environment, and the sounds of fire—through burn barrels, flame effects, and spinners—join in the overall soundscape.67 Because theme camps tend to be grouped together based on the times in which they are most active, it is possible to gauge the approximate time of day based on where activity (and therefore volume) is occurring. For example, each day when I walked through “Eden,” a neighborhood at Transformus, at approximately two P.M., there was a bustle of noise and activity. However, when I went back at two A.M., “Eden” was considerably more quiet. Vice versa, when I visited “Valhalla,” a sound- camp neighborhood at Transformus, at two P.M. it was quieter each day than it was by comparison at two A.M., when theme camp sound systems were pushed to their limits. Furthermore, some events were centered around a specific time. In my interview with Jessie, Frostburn’s placement coordinator, she mentioned how certain events at Frostburn, such as ““White Dragon Noodle Bar’s” [vegan mushroom ramen give away] happen every single day at a certain time of day like clockwork.”68 At Firefly on

Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at twelve A.M., “Midnight Poutine” served up fresh, greasy French-fries topped with gravy and cheese curds to the masses.69 “Midnight Poutine” members Arno and Jean estimated that “ballpark 120” individual portions of poutine were served each night, feeding twelve percent of Firefly’s population.70 Thursday night as I perused the Firefly grounds, I noticed an odd quieting in the amount of people-activity around twelve-thirty A.M.—prime time in the burn’s nighttime soundscape. “Where is everyone?” I thought. As I continued my loop around Firefly’s perimeter, it became clear to me that the groups of people that had been dancing at various sound camps, such as “Axiom,” “Camp Lamp,” “The Lion’s Den,” “Totenkitten,” and “Electric Kool-Aid Vision Quest” were congregating at “Midnight Poutine.” The following night when the same lull occurred, I knew exactly where everyone went. These types of specifically timed events serve as an indicator of time for burn participants.
Moore and Smallwood write, “through a familiarity with their surroundings, participants quickly develop an intuition about the precise time of day that comes as much from a reading of the sounds surrounding them as it does from the position of the sun and the sensation of temperature” (2011, 50). The natural environment, where and when activity occurs, the types and volume of music, and event markers at a burn serve as acoustemological signifiers of time.

Date
In a similar manner to the way in which sounds can indicate time of day, sounds
can also signify the approximate day of the week (Moore and Smallwood 2011). For the first twenty-four to forty-eight hours of a burn, the sounds of arrival and construction permeate the air. “Gate” and “Greeters” stations bustle with the activity of arriving participants (more so in the first two days than later on). There, gate and greeter volunteers check tickets, ids, gift “schwag” (such as stickers, wristbands, and necklaces), provide directions and hugs, dish out “virgin spankings,” and educate burn virgins in the ten principles.71 At regular intervals, cars, moving trucks, RVs, and large cars towing squeaky hitches stuffed to the brim enter and pass through the burn en route to their camping location (or the parking lot).72 Gravel crunches—or sometimes if its grass, squishes—under the weight of each passing vehicle. Amplified music reverberates out of rolled-down vehicle windows, growing louder as each vehicle approaches and fades away as each vehicle passes, akin to a constant changing of the radio station. In all directions, people excitedly greet one another, laughing, talking animatedly, and yelling “welcome home!”73 The back gates of trucks slam open, their contents hastily unloaded and stacked on the ground by groups of people. All around, building sounds diffuse through the air as

participants construct their temporary city. Some theme camps, coordination teams, and art grant recipients enter a day or two early to begin the set up process before general admission opens, extending the building portion of the week. During this time, the sounds of people working together, particularly giving and asking for directions, is prominent.74 Speakers (in many locations) pump out a variety of music for participants to listen to while they work. Thick steel tent poles clank together as they’re organized by type and dropped on to the ground in piles.75 Pairs of people unfold large crinkling tarps.76 Metal stakes clank as they are pounded into the ground.77 Ratchet straps click as they are tightened.78 A few generators hum, providing energy for power-tools and for work-lights at night. Listening closely, one can hear the popping of nail guns, the shrieking of circular saws cutting wood, and the whirring of drills fastening screws into wood, followed by the quick rapping successions of thunk-thunk-thunk-thunk when the screw-head becomes flush with the wood’s surface.79 By night, building sounds are less

salient, as participants finish up or take a break from constructing or decorating (though some continue working through the night). The first night of the burn is quieter than Friday and Saturday, as tired participants catch up on their sleep (while they still can). As the city nears completion, the soundscape changes. Work sounds morph into sounds of play. As Firefly participant Andrew notes, “day-by-day things kind of escalated. [...] Even the kinds of music, the excitement, and the energy that people brought, even day to day was very different. Friday was different from Saturday was different from Sunday.”80 As the week progresses, the soundscape becomes more and more vibrant with varying activities, revving up to the climax of the week—Saturday evening’s burn. Moore and Smallwood state that “the micro-soundscape of this event is among the most bewildering and intense to be found in the city at any moment,” but do not offer an extended discussion of what aurally happens there (2011, 51). Here I elaborate:
Just before nine P.M. on Saturday night, the sounds of tribal drumming (or in some cases amplified music) from the effigy field call to burners to gather around the effigy.81 Hundreds of burners in small groups walk, talk, laugh, and wittily-banter their way to the effigy. (Hearing so many burners walking with purpose toward a single direction is, in its own right, fascinating. Trying to get burners together to do anything is likened by participants to “herding cats.”) Many bring their art-cars, instruments, or their hand-held flame effects, and these too contribute to the effigy’s high-energy soundscape.

At the effigy, participants can be heard searching for their friends, offering each other gifts, calling out “happy burn!”, and generally being silly.82 Because most of the burn’s participants are gathered around the effigy, the highest concentration of people-related noise can be found there, while the rest of the city quiets down. The burn begins with a performance from the fire conclave. Fire-breathers and fire-spinners with a variety of props, including poi, fans, staffs, nunchucks, levitation wand, rope-dart, swords, juggling clubs, and even umbrellas and marionettes, perform. Each of these fire-props has its own individual sound, and can be distinguished by an experienced listener. The way in which this performance happens depends on the burn. Sometimes, conclave spinners are assigned particular positions ahead of time, where they spin until their fire-props die off. Other times, conclave spinners enter one at a time and spin counter-clockwise around the effigy.83 When more conclave spinners are present, a burn may present a series of spinners together in waves. When there are fewer, conclave spinners may be able to perform more than once, moving around the effigy on their own. Typically, the more fire-spinners there are, the longer the fire conclave lasts. Spinners improvise their fire- spinning, or perform choreographed routines in a group. Fire-spinner spotters, known as “safeties,” stand nearby, occasionally calling out to fire-spinners to inform them that their shirt or the ground near them has caught fire. The crowd is a key element in the fire

83 POrtalburn was the exception in this case. There, because of the effigy’s placement next to a pond, everyone gathered on a sloping hill in front of the effigy. The fire conclave performed next to the effigy, moving clock-wise around the pond.

When a particularly unique fire-prop enters or an impressive display of choreography occurs, the crowd hoots, hollers, and claps ecstatically.84 When a fire-prop dies out, the crowd politely acknowledges the spinner’s performance by clapping. Once the fire conclave’s performance has completed, it is time to burn the effigy. Sometimes, the artist or build team first makes a speech. Other times the fire safety team silently moves in to create a safety perimeter around the effigy, while a single person lights the effigy with a flame-thrower or torch. There are a few clear sound patterns as the effigy burns. When it first lights, the crowd cheers. Then the crowd’s sound diminishes slightly as small groups talk amongst themselves, waiting for the effigy to fall.85 Meanwhile, the drummer’s conclave (or amplified music) continues to play and nearby participants dance

and clap to the beat of the music. With each partial collapse of the effigy, the crowd hurrahs; the bigger the collapse, the bigger the clamor.86 When the effigy finally falls into itself, completing its demise, the crowd deafeningly roars. The fire safety team gives the “go-ahead” signal and burners begin running counter-clockwise around the effigy. The sounds of heavy boots stampeding around the effigy, amidst howls, claps, and laughs saturates the air. Some burners stay to watch the effigy embers burn, though most scatter quickly, returning to their theme camps and beginning the night’s festivities. Saturday night’s celebration is loud and long as participants celebrate through the sunrise.
However, sometimes the date that the effigy burns can change. For example, my first year at Frostburn in 2015, a blizzard came through that made it impossible for the effigy to light. The effigy service was moved to Sunday, and though it was disappointing, it did not really seem to matter. In an on-site interview at Alchemy, Zephyr told me that this had happened “at-least once before at Firefly” as well, when the effigy “wouldn’t light ‘cause it was too damp.”87 Alchemy this year had a similar issue. Because of the southern drought, officials banned large structure fires at the last minute and the effigy and temple were not allowed to be burned. This transferred into Alchemy’s soundscape. At the fire conclave, which did happen anyway, participants could be heard yelling “a very merry happy un-burn day to you!” or a variety of other similar sentiments. Although some participants did not seem to care about the lack of the

effigy burn, saying “a burn is a burn, whether we burn the effigy or not,” others seemed disappointed or confused on what to do after the fire conclave was over.88 In my recording of Alchemy’s fire conclave, participants wondered aloud whether they should run around the effigy or not (a lot did), and after conclave concluded, many gathered inside the effigy to hang out instead.89
At the regionals I attended, Sunday’s soundscape was considerably different from the rest of the week, but the extent to which it changed depended on the burn. For example, at Wickerman, all participants were asked to exit the property by sundown. For the others, the burn continued until Monday. However, at PDF and Alchemy, many participants left early and so the sounds of pack-up and exodus pervaded more strongly than at Firefly, Transformus, and Frostburn. Still, on Sundays at Firefly, Transformus, and Frostburn, theme camps began taking down non-essential decorations and structures, and organizing their personal belongings in an effort to minimize Monday’s labors. The sounds of de-construction, though similar to the sounds of Wednesday and Thursday’s construction, differ in their enthusiasm and are reversed. (For example, bins are loaded onto trucks, as opposed to taken off. Metal geodesic dome poles fall to the ground, as opposed to being picked up and held in place.) The activities that take place on Sunday are generally more low-key and a sense of calm spreads over the burn’s inhabitants. At Transformus, many lounged at the lake all day, sun-bathing, floating on rafts, drinking

fruity cocktails, and picnicking. At Frostburn, groups cuddled up inside, making art, performing at open mics, playing games, or watching movies. Brunch events and the gifting out of extra food was a common theme for Sunday’s activities amongst all the burns. Sometimes, Sunday contained a temple or an art-burn and the soundscape of this event served as an additional marker of the day. However, at regionals, the temple/art burn soundscape is less precise than Moore and Smallwood argue. At Burning Man, the temple burn happens on Sunday night. There, “the tens of thousands of people gathered at the temple burn are almost universally silent” (Moore and Smallwood 2011, 51). At regionals, the temple service happens at different times depending on the burn, or in other cases when there is no temple, it does not happen at all. At Firefly, Transformus, and POrtalburn, the temple burn happened at night, but at Wickerman and Alchemy, the temple burn was scheduled for the morning.90 PDF and Frostburn did not have a temple, but rather an art burn, in which art that was made for or at the burn was set on fire. The temple burn at Firefly and Transformus had a similar soundscape to that of Burning Man, marked by the absence of sound, the occasional admonishing “shh!,” the somber playing of a violin, or carefully selected songs for singing.91 Though the temple and the effigy are both large structure fires, even the sound of the fire burning in the temple can sound different from the effigy. Andrew reflects on Firefly’s effigy and temple:
The sound of the bug burning, I don’t know... it pounded at you, that fire. It was just wild and strong and powerful... whereas [the temple] was quiet
                                                      
90 Because of the burn ban due to drought, the temple at Alchemy was not burned, but a small service with a few fire-spinners took place instead.

and subdued and controlled. I don’t know. They must have built it differently because it was a much more calm and peaceful sound.92
The temple at POrtalburn, however, had a similar soundscape to its own art-burn and the art burns of PDF and Frostburn. Considerably fewer people attend the art burn than the temple or the effigy. There, talking is permitted and sounds like a mellowed version of the night’s previous effigy burn, sans the fire conclave, art cars, and flame-effects.93 Though some theme camps still offer a place to party and dance on Sunday night, most burn participants choose instead to rest in preparation for Monday’s departure.
On Monday, the sounds of mass exodus saturate the soundscape as burners finish packing up, load up their vehicles, say good-bye to one another, and exit the property.94 By late afternoon the burn soundscape completes its cycle, once again sounding as it did before anyone arrived.
In conclusion, like Moore and Smallwood, I argue that the soundscape of a burn can be used as an acoustemological indicator of date, in the similar way that it can be used to mark time. However, I differ from their argument in that I believe that the regional burn soundscape signifiers for date are substantially less precise than those for time or location.

Location
So far, I have established how burners can acoustemologically tell when they are
in the burn. But what about where they are? Moore and Smallwood write that:
Traversing Black Rock City’s diverse territory demonstrates the communicative power of the distinctions between its regions, as the nature of an area being entered often announces itself to the ear before the eye perceives a change. In this way, consciously perceiving the soundscape serves to increase the circumference of one’s awareness of one’s surroundings beyond the present visual horizon in a way that is coherent, informative, and useful in navigation (2011, 49).
I argue that this statement is not limited to the confines of Black Rock City. In this section, I will elaborate on Moore and Smallwood’s article to describe how soundmarks and audial-related city planning helped burn participants aurally find their way around the burn.
Schafer defines soundmark as a term “derived from landmark [that] refers to a community sound which is unique or possesses qualities which make it specially regarded or noticed by the people in that community” (1977, 10). At a burn, soundmarks are usually some kind of placed (intentional or unintentional) sound-art. In the “Theoretical Frameworks” section of this thesis, I discussed two art pieces with unintentional sound elements that were brought to Burning Man and one intentional sound-art piece, “The Laser Harp Fire Calliope,” that was brought to Wickerman. Here, I focus on two sound-art pieces I encountered that served as acoustemological soundmarks of the burn environment. (Though this was certainly not all of them, for they were common and numerous at burns!)
“The Flaming Hookers” was an unintentional sound-art piece that I encountered
at Firefly. It was originally made for “Charnival,” a series of fire-themed carnival games
 
62
at Burning Man 2015. (See Figure 10.) The artists, Deanna, TJ, and Tom, came up with the idea to create a fiery ring toss game in which players swing their own metal ring, attached to a chain, in an attempt to land it on a metal hook. Three players—one on easy,

one on medium, and one on hard—can play simultaneously. The rings and hooks “are electrified [so when the ring lands on the hook], it closes the circuit and opens a valve”
which results in a
celebratory, loud and whistling stream of fire that shoots up out of the top.95 “The Flaming Hookers” was an art piece located at the corner of “Mercurial Path” and “Photon Flow” (street names) in
the north-west quadrant of the burn. At night, the clanking of the rings and the shrieking fire could be heard from a considerable distance. Because the game required its operators in order to play, the whistling fire served as an acoustic signal that “The Flaming Hookers” was open for business.96 In a few occasions, I overheard participants comment on the sound to their friends, then walk off towards it in the hopes to “finally play.”

96 The sound of “The Flaming Hookers” is an exemplary case of night-time flame effects that mark the time of day.
  
63
Furthermore, how close the sound was and where it was coming from served as an acoustic indicator of one’s placement at Firefly.
In a similar way, Jen’s sound-art piece, “Tintinntabulum,” marked one’s relative location at Alchemy. “Tintinntabulum” was a large wind-chime, consisting of two pitched helium tanks and a variety of other objects, such as croquet balls and wooden blocks. When the wind blew strongly, or when participants played with it, the objects tapped against the cut-to-pitch helium tanks, producing a loud, resonant, bell-like quality.97 However, unlike “The Flaming Hookers,” “Tintinntabulum” intentionally incorporated sound. In an interview with Jen, she deliberated how she chose the objects and how she wanted to develop the art-piece for future burns:
It’s really just the beginning. [...] I want to do some different things with tuning and pulleys and different metallic sounds too. But nothing abrasive, ‘cause I don’t want people to go “God, I wish they’d take that thing down.” I want them to come by and just dig it. [...] I tried a number of objects to see what I liked best, the problem with the blocks is that it makes a more muted sound... they are too light, so I’m going to have to find something a little more heavier on there. That’s just part of what’s in progress.98
In other words, creating appealing sounds that burn participants would be intrigued by and want to listen to was an important part of Jen’s creative process. Jen recognized that the helium tank bells could be heard from long distances, and that the sound, similar to “The Flaming Hookers,” aroused the curiosity of both those passing by and those far

away. As burners discovered what and where “Tintinntabulum” was, it could then be used as an acoustic marker of space.
When it comes to planning how theme camps are placed, sound is an important deciding factor. However, not all of the regional burns I attended followed the same pattern. Theme camp placement depended on the property and the size of the burn. For the larger regionals, such as Transformus and Alchemy, theme camps were organized by the types of activities that occur there, as well as their overall volume. Pyrocelt, a past placement team lead for Transformus, explains:
So basically there’s not a lot of regulations on site. It’s kind of an anarchistic event. It’s also kind of a freedom utopia event. People have described it as “better than heaven,” “these are all the things I’d want in my life, I can’t believe they’re all here.” That being said people have different things they want in their little patch of heaven. And as someone who has the ability to lay out and organize in advance, we try to give people similar things around them. So people that really like food, that’s cool... put a couple of food camps together. [...] Likewise, we have adult neighborhoods that have all the kinky “fet” things going on there. [...] Likewise, if you like big fuckin’ asshole loud sound systems we have a place for you. And we’ll put you together with your friends and if your friends trounce you, bring a bigger sound system next year. Sometimes it works out like magic. [...] Sometimes it’s really tricky.99
Pyrocelt’s description matches Transformus’ sound policy which explains that “theme camps are placed in areas with similar sound tastes in order to help create neighborhood cohesion and to create a variety of spaces for our citizens” (Transformus 2017a). For example, the majority of kink-related theme camps were placed in “Elysium Fields,” which allowed amplified sound from eight A.M. until two A.M. and by-permit-only limited amplified sound during the other six hours. Many sit-and-chill camps were
                                                      
99 Pyrocelt, interview with author, March 30, 2017. 65
  
located in “Argonath,” which allowed amplified sound from eight A.M. until eleven P.M. Sound camps, also known as dance camps, were located in “Valhalla” or “Shangri-La” which both permitted twenty-four hour amplified sound.100 For Dale, Alchemy’s 2016 placement lead, the layout of a burn is crucial to its success. In his manifesto, “Patterns: the language of burn layout and placement,” Dale outlines twenty burn design patterns that he “believe[s] have some level of applicability to efforts in creating a meaningful, purposeful community.” Many of the patterns in the manifesto align with Pyrocelt’s statements and Transformus’ sound policy guidelines. For example, his first pattern is “break the city, as far as possible, into a mosaic of small and different subcultures.” When placing camps, Dale actively thinks about Alchemy’s “sub-subcultures,” such as “furries, kink, acid goth pixie, et al.” and where they would be happiest (2016, 3).101 He has found that usually, this is together in a group. In my online conversation with Dale, he noted that “‘red light’ camps prefer to be close together and out of the way,” and that often, similarly themed camps, such as sound camps, ask to “village” together.102 When I asked him how he figured this out, he showed me his theme camp registration form. (Interestingly, this form was the same one I had filled out when I registered Thesis Camp
                                                      
100 I do not imply that all similarly themed camps at Transformus camped together. For example, there were “sit-and-chill” camps located within “Valhalla,” just as there were dance camps located within “Xanadu,” another Transformus village. However, the meticulous groupings of theme camps at Transformus and Alchemy cannot be overlooked.

for Alchemy, but at that time, I did not think twice about the questions he asked!) In it, he asks TCOs to characterize their theme camp’s sound. Using their responses, Dale places similarly sounding theme camps near each other in order to create a cohesive aural scheme. Furthermore, certain camps had a particular shtick, such as the boff battle arena at “Kamp Khaos,” and the sound of that theme camp in its element served as a distinct aural soundmark.103 Once participants learned what types of theme camps (and therefore sounds) were where, they could use the soundscape of the area to roughly place themselves on the burn’s map. Furthermore, the soundscape provided insight into the diversity of “sub-subcultures” and the variety of activities present at the burns; aural reminders of the principles “radical inclusion” and “radical self-expression.”
Also on Alchemy’s registration form, TCOs must classify their theme camp as “outward-facing, inward-facing, or bedroom.” Dale explains:
An outward-facing camp is one that provides an activity or serve for the burn as a whole. They want all the hippies to come to their camp. An inward-facing camp, on the other hand, is not so performance-oriented. They’re not unwelcoming—they may in fact be open chill/lounge spaces—but they’re not set up to encourage all the hippies to troop through (2016, 12). [... Bedroom camps] are a ‘home base’ camp that in general doesn’t put on a show for the rest of the burn. They’re not closed, necessarily, but they are not structured to host the population at large.104
In my participant observation at all of the seven regional burns, the outward-facing camps were the loudest of the theme camps, not only because they were often sound camps, but also because they attracted and could handle the most amount of people. By contrast, the

bedroom camps, such as “Kids Camp” at Firefly or “Sleepy Sloth Village” at Transformus, were the quietest, and were usually placed “out of the way so that the passeggiata [didn’t] lead right to them.”105 Inward-facing camps’ loudness levels were somewhere in the middle. However, it is not that all of the outward facing theme camps are clumped together and that all of the inward-facing camps are lumped together somewhere else. (Though the bedroom camps and quiet areas for individual camping, such as “Mute Swan Meadow” at POrtalburn, usually were.) In fact, placement leads try very hard to create “clusters of activity [that] give flow to the burn.”106 Dale explains, “outward-facing camps are our goals, i.e., the places that we need to shunt traffic to” (2016, 12). This was particularly true at the smaller burns, such as POrtalburn and Frostburn, that had less land and fewer theme camps to explore. Teeth, placement lead for POrtalburn 2016 explained that when placing camps, he thinks of ways to “promote walkabouts.”107 Jessie, placement coordinator for Frostburn has a similar method. When I asked her how she decides where to put each theme camp, she replied:
There’s an area that is higher traffic within Frostburn. Camps that are put on the ends are either sound camps or what I think of as “destination camps,” someone that draws a lot of people. [For example,] “Priority Five” is one that I think of as an anchor camp. I don’t worry, because people are going to want to go there, so they anchor [one] end of the theme camp area.108

As a result, burn participants must walk past many of the inward-facing theme camps in order to reach the desired outward-facing destination camps. But there is another reason to separate the outward-facing theme camps and it has everything to do with sound.
As Pyrocelt’s earlier comments describe, a burn is a place of “radical inclusion,” where participants with many different interests are welcomed and respected. It is also a place where “radical self-expression” is held to the highest regard; a place where participants can be themselves and express their creativity without fear of being judged.109 Although sound-artists, DJs, and musicians may consider their sound-art a “gift” to the community, others believe that sound has “an unfair advantage over other art forms” (Burning Man Project 2017g).110 As Schafer states, “the sense of hearing cannot be closed off at will. There are no earlids” (1977, 11). At a burn, noise is inescapable. However, because “noise is an essentially relational concept [that] can only take on meaning by signifying something else” (Novak 2015, 126), at what point at a burn does noise cross over the relative boundary into “unpleasant” or “too loud”? Aurally, when does one’s entitled “radical self-expression” impinge on someone else’s and the eleventh principle— “consent?” At all of the regional burns I attended, sound camps were methodically placed in order to minimize these types of aural conflicts within the
                                                      
109 House Cat, conversation with author at PDF, October 8, 2016.
110 I noticed this first hand at my first burn. (See the “Preface.”) St. John (2017, 2014, and 2009b) has written about sound camps’ complicated relationship with Burning Man and the issues that have transpired between sound camps and the rest of the Burning Man populace over the years.

community.111 At the larger burns, sound camps were “placed in their own neighborhood, or neighborhoods, if land permit[ted] but arranged so that sound bleed [was] not excessive” (Lyles 2016, 9). At the smaller burns, sound camps were spread out so that their music didn’t interfere with each other, or “bother other camps, especially other camps that [did] lower volume audio.” Jessie explains:
Like “Camp Illumination,” they play movies. You can’t hear an outdoor style movie if the music is too loud from two camps over. It’s a balance between everyone getting to do what they want and being able to do what they want, which is different.112
Although not perfect, placement leads took careful note of each theme camp’s audio needs, positioning them appropriately depending on their preferences and activities. The mindful way in which theme camps are organized by sound demonstrates the importance of “radical self-expression” and “consent” in the burn community.
Public and Private Spaces
Pyrocelt’s description of a burn as an “anarchistic, freedom utopia” may lead
someone unfamiliar to the burn culture to believe that participants run rampant, expressing themselves however, whenever, and wherever they please. Not once during my participant observation did I encounter a space sectioned off, locked, or marked as “closed” to the general populace. In spite of this, there were clear public and private
                                                      
111 Some burns implement a rule that limits the maximum decibel levels that a camp can project at any time. Sound is not only a problem within the burn, but also for the surrounding community as well. Many regionals, such as PDF, PreHeat (FL), Afterburn (FL), Alchemy, Santa Cruz Decompression (CA), and London Decompression (UK) have been “in danger of being cancelled or being forced to find a new home” due to noise complaints from nearby neighbors (Blizzard 2017).
112 Jessie, interview with author, April 6, 2017. 70
  
spaces within the burn. On the whole, participants were respectful of one another’s personal space. Ethnomusicologist Andrew J. Eisenberg writes that “the sonorous enactments of publicity and privacy in inhabited spaces [territorialize spaces by] virtue of combining physical vibration with bodily sensation and culturally conditioned meanings” (2015, 199). In this section, I will analyze how sound, or lack of sound, at a burn can indicate to burn participants where or where not to go.
During my participant observation, the most obvious indicator that it was time for me to go to finally go to bed was the lack of sounds happening around me. At some point in the early morning, usually around four A.M., the volume level of the soundscape scaled back.113 A few of the sound-camps might have been still blasting away, but to much smaller crowds.114 Inward-facing theme camps had, for the most part, shut down for the evening. Those still active were usually comprised of a small number of people relaxing quietly in a cuddle puddle, making art, or sitting around a fire-pit. Bedroom camps were “silent.”115 Especially for inward-facing theme camps, or camps with closed entranceways (such as all of the theme camps at Frostburn, guarded against the cold), active sonic environments signaled that a camp was open and accepting visitors. Pyrocelt

On the dance floor, the lack of people noises interwoven with the loud music (talking, laughing, or the sound of cups/utensils jingling on people’s hips as they dance) exemplifies a subdued activity level.

reflects:
Like sometimes you can just go to a neighborhood and just listen and see where people are. [...] You can listen and see where the people are still up, chippering away and whatever they’re doing.116
Quieter territories (as opposed to quiet natural environments on the outskirts of the burn) more often than not signaled the opposite, that a theme camp was closed and to come back later. One burner, Brian, explained:
If there isn’t much sound I usually assume nobody is home or they are sleeping. [...] I’ve learned most burners will keep the metaphorical lamp oil burning until they are absolutely totally ready for bed. If there is no generator noise especially—dead give-away.117
In these instances, if Brian thought “a buddy might be in there” he would “still peek [his] head in,” but he did not enter the theme camp without consent. To Brian the absence of sound at a theme camp semiotically notified him that the once public space had become, for the meantime, private.
Like Pyrocelt and Brian experienced, I found that listening to the sounds, or lack of sounds, around me was a helpful navigational tool. The presence of certain sounds, such as hushed whispers, people arguing, crying, or otherwise agitated emotional sounds, indicated that a certain place was temporarily private and not to be disturbed. When I was searching for activity, I listened for an appealing sonic timbre and followed it. Other times, when the burn’s overwhelming sonic environment became too much, I sought out a tranquil place, such as a twenty-four-hour meditative theme camp or a gifted hammock set up in the trees. (I could not find these by using sound, but rather sight; one limitation

of aural ethnography.) The presence of these types of theme camps and installations indicate that I am not alone in seeking out a quiet respite from the burn’s conglomerate soundscape. Brian confirms:
When I'm happy and confident I will run as fast as possible to the loudest dance spot I can find and stay there until I have to run just as fast back to peace. Sometimes the overlapping jenny [generator] noise and too much EDM fucks with me and I get really bad anxiety. I cannot sleep and I just want to crawl into a noiseless cave. [In those cases] I LOVE really peaceful or soundless places and those soundscapes are relaxing to me.118
Pyrocelt too noted that “if [he didn’t] want to hang out with the drunken hoards,” he avoided the places in which sounds were more prevalent.119
Furthermore, within every theme camp there is usually a combination of public space and private space. For instance, at Tranformus, “Party Liberation Front” (“PLF”) was one of the largest sound camps, complete with a massive circus tent, a dance floor, a bar, and various art installations, all of which was open twenty-four hours a day for burners to enjoy. However, not all of “PLF” was public space. At Transformus 2016, “PLF” had over one hundred theme camp members and those members individually camped in the tree-line behind and next to “PLF’s” hang-out space. Exploring their theme camp, it was apparent when I had crossed the invisible line from their communal area into their personal camping zone: the wild, raging sounds of their public space were muted by the tree-line. I immediately felt like I was trespassing. I was not a “PLF” member, nor was I accompanied by a “PLF” member. The sudden dampening of the once sonorous soundscape made me uncomfortable and I quickly retraced my steps back

into the noisy refuge.
Throughout my thesis, I have consistently referred to the burn soundscape as
endlessly cacophonous. So in this section, when I write of “silent” or “quiet” theme camps or areas of the burn, it should be known that I speak referentially. Even in the quietest areas, there is almost always the hum of a generator close by, the chatter of a nearby conversation, the poofing of far off flame effect, and the endless thumping of distant music. “Thus how silence is understood depends in good measure on how the relationship between the listener and his or her surroundings are conceptualized” (Ochoa Gautier 2015, 185). These types of constant sounds become the norm; the background “keynote sounds” that are typically not “listened to consciously” by burn participants, but “become listening habits in spite of themselves” (Schafer 1977, 9).120 For example, in the previous section “Time,” I wrote about how I visited “Sacred and Profane” for a meditative, rosemary smoke bath. While I was in there, I was focused on the sounds of the relaxing music, my steady breath and the breathing of the people around me, the occasional un-zippering, zippering, opening, and closing of the smoke bath door, and the careful steps of the smoke bath’s participants entering and exiting.121 In that moment, my selective listening regarded “Sacred and Profane’s” environment as quiet. Yet, in the recording I took, it is clear that a variety of keynote burn sounds were, in reality,
                                                      
120 Schafer argues that “the keynote sounds of a given place are important because they help to outline the character of men living among them.” In this case, I adapt Schafer’s definition of “keynote sounds” to denote the burn community’s most prevalent, pervasive sounds, as opposed to those “created by its geography” (1977, 9).

happening all around me. Hence, “if silence implies a relation between (non)hearing and perception, then it depends on the types of entities or events that produce and perceive it” (Ochoa Gautier 2015, 189). A place at a burn may never be silent, but the fact that such noises can fly under the radar of “perception” bespeaks burners’ listening practices. In certain occasions, such as investigating the private areas of a theme camp, figuring out which theme camps were closed, or seeking out a soothing place to rest, it was the silences that were apprehended. Other times, it was the presence of sounds that aurally designated where to go.
Experience Moore and Smallwood write that:
As [Burning Man’s] population swells, its culture inevitably shifts as well. Participants arriving on Friday have not experienced the construction of the city, and they come more as tourists than residents. Sometimes their behavior reflects an ethos disconnected from the event’s principles. Not surprisingly, this difference can be discerned in the sounds they produce, and, while subtle, this new color in the sonic fabric is perceived and remarked upon by participants every year (2011, 51).
The regionals I attended were much smaller, less known, and shorter than the annual event in Nevada. From my observations, I gathered that most of the regionals' population arrived when gate opened and stayed until Sunday night. Furthermore, those who were new to the community had usually found out about it from an experienced burner who had informed them about the culture and the principles ahead of time. The principles were an active topic of discussion at the gate and greeters tent and even at some events, such as Alchemy’s “Education Decathalon,” which taught “newbies” about the principles
 
75
through a series of field-day inspired events.122 (Tug-of-war, with a few people on each team was a practice in “communal effort,” and a game of “Mother May I?” was played to practice “consent.”) Perhaps for these reasons, I perceived less of a culture change throughout the weekend than Moore and Smallwood observed at the Nevada event. I did, however, notice that participants’ experience levels (i.e. virgin versus veteran) could sometimes be gathered by how they reacted and verbally responded towards the sounds in their environment—particularly to heckling, flame effects, and fire-spinning.
Heckling, which Heller describes as “as a form of play at Burning Man,” is an established form of humor in the burn community (2013, 83). However, it can be somewhat of a tricky action to describe. Heckling is best explained through stories, as Heller, my informants JoAnna, Pyrocelt, and I came to realize. Here, I include two stories to help clarify. The first is my own.
It was Thursday afternoon at Transformus 2016 and I was in the middle of a four- hour volunteer shift for the “Back Door Brigade,” a subsection of the Department of City Planning that helps individual campers find their open camping spots on site. However, because I had been stationed in “Valhalla,” the loudest neighborhood at Transformus, the afternoon was dragging by slowly. Very few open campers wanted to willingly set up their sleeping quarters there. As I sat, hoping that an arriving participant would come by needing my assistance, a man standing next to a large truck at the theme camp across the road (“PLF”) yelled out “hey can anybody help me?” After quickly affirming that my shift lead “brigadier” would be okay to man the post without me, I ran over to see how I

76
could help.123 By then, a few of his fellow “PLF” members, including my friend JoAnna, had congregated around the truck. The man, whose name I learned was Christian, had brought his large-scale interactive art piece, “Josephine the Colossal Skeletal Marionette,” a “giant, two-story, skeleton marionette [controlled] from seven different
  Figure 11. “Josephine the Colossal Skeletal Marionette.” Photography by Nomakim Photography at Transformus 2016.
points” via ropes, to share with Transformus’ community.124 Because of her size, Christian and his co-creator Jessica needed our help to set Josephine up. JoAnna and I got to work bolting pieces of Josephine together when suddenly a group of eager looking
participants, holding their
WhatWhereWhen booklets walked up to us and asked, “is this where acroyoga is?” JoAnna, a keen jokester with a
dry sense of humor immediately responded, “yes, absolutely. This is where acroyoga is.
                                                      
123 Often I heard participants in need asking the general vicinity of people around them for help. (E.g. “Does anybody have a hammer?” Does anybody have a band-aid?” Can anybody help me?”) In every instance that I heard/witnessed this, someone, or multiple people, came to the rescue. Such occurrences showed how “communal effort” is valued in the community and is balanced with “radical self reliance.”

Christian Breeden and Jessica Eberlin.

Josephine will be leading acroyoga.” “Great!” the group replied, and believing her fib to be true, they stood in a huddle, looking over the WhatWhereWhen booklet, waiting for acroyoga to start. JoAnna and I continued to work, ignoring the group, and tried hard to keep from giggling at their naiveté. JoAnna reflects:
We let them wait for quite a while. I didn’t tell them it wasn’t acroyoga... but someone did. You were going along with it. It really was very easy to convince them that a giant skeleton puppet was going to be their acroyoga teacher.125
Eventually, someone clued them in that the scheduled three P.M. acroyoga class at “PLF” had been cancelled, because the theme camp was clearly not set up yet for visitors. The group realized that JoAnna was teasing them and left, laughing to themselves saying “I can’t believe we fell for that!” In that moment, I thought “those poor virgins. They just don’t get it yet.” When I asked JoAnna to recount this moment, she laughed and told me that she had honestly forgotten about it until I said something. “That’s like standard operating procedure for me,” she noted. “Because of the heckling I do, it’s mostly giving absurd answers to absurd questions and experienced people know better. So my interactions from them are very different.”126
In my interview with Pyrocelt, he told a similar story:
My friend one year went around announcing that an acid rain cloud was coming in that would melt your skin. “Please leave Transformus, the burn is pretty much cancelled and only come back if you buy five pounds of baking soda to neutralize it.” [Transformus’ team leads] finally track him down when the people at the gate were like, “why is everyone leaving?” And people were like “we heard acid rain was coming!” [...] It’s part of the culture of Burning Man culture that goes back a very long time—being

78
full of information and misinformation. The level of pranksters is inherent to burns itself and goes back to the very foundations of burns. And is expressed through sound culture, if you will.127
When I shared Pyrocelt’s story with JoAnna, she commented “Oh my God. Yeah, I mean once you’ve rodeo’d, you know better, probably.”128 In both cases, the groups reacting to JoAnna and Pyrocelt’s friend’s pranks were most likely inexperienced burn participants, who hadn’t realized that they were being heckled. In her dissertation, Heller devotes an entire chapter to the practice of heckling. She writes:
Heckling is a social act that has a playful intent for the most part. In verbally attacking another person, a person may intend to foster a festive atmosphere that they associate with making fun and playing pranks. In this sense heckling can be a play practice for getting into and expressing a mood of play at Burning Man. [...] However, heckling is a form of dark play, in which only one side may actually be experiencing a playful mood. Jokes are highly subjective and may require some insider knowledge (2013, 84).
In Heller’s case, she is mostly discussing the joking practices of the “assholes on megaphones” that Pyrocelt describes (see “Appendix B”), who stand on soapboxes and “publically tease and antagonize people” walking by (Heller 2013, 81).129 In my experience, heckling additionally includes the public pranking and teasing described by JoAnna and Pyrcocelt.130 Experienced burners familiar with such practices either learn to

“absolutely adore” them or ignore them.131 However, as Heller explains, “newcomer[s] may not entirely grasp the heckler’s meaning or intention,” (2013, 84) and their reactions, such as “I can’t believe we fell for that!” or attempting to leave Transformus, are evidence of their inexperience.
I have also noticed that burners’ response to the sound of flame effects can reveal their level of experience at burns. As a newbie, the sudden blast of an igniting fire poofer or flame thrower scared the bejeezus out of me. The sound was incredibly startling and very hard to get used to.132 Now, however, the once scary noises sound like home to me. The louder the poofer, the more I tend to like it and cheer it on. Pyrocelt, a flame effects artist who purposefully attempts to create loud fire poofers, has noticed this trend in the burn population as well. He observes:
I find you can tell people who are experienced burners from people who have not been to a burn before when large flame effects go off. They are concerned and humans have a real genetic predisposition to be afraid of fire, for pretty good survival reasons. [...] As humans in caves we were really designed to watch the fire: is it out?; do we put more wood in it?; is it burning down the cave?; do we need to run? It’s an instinctual response we have that many burners, who are experienced burners, have entirely learned to overcome. When a giant fireball goes off and the whole sky lights up, they just keep on talking. Two other people are jumping, like “what the fuck was that? Should I be scared?” And they’re like “No, no, it’s fine! It’s just some asshole with his flame effects.”133

In a similar vein, the way in which fire-spinners react to and understand the sounds of their fire props indicates their level of experience.134 To anyone that has spun fire or stood near a fire-spinner, there is an audible whooshing sound that corresponds to the fire prop’s flame moving through space. As noted in the “Date” section, fire props have their own individual sounds, due to wick size and movement patterns, and these, Tiger and Andrew say, can be identified by experienced spinners who know what to listen for.135 Pyrocelt notes that as a beginner “it’s always shocking to hear the sound of the fire all around you. It’s very distracting and not what you would expect.”136 (See Figure 12 and sound-clip 33.) In my interview with Tiger, a dragon-staff spinner, she said something similar:
I think it’s almost a little bit startling. [...] It almost took me off guard how loud it was. Like, you don’t hear it until you’re in the middle of it. It’s like having ear buds in. Nobody else can hear it quite the way that you can, because its surrounding you on both sides. You don’t get that until you’re actually the one spinning it.137
Once she became accustomed to the sounds, however, Tiger was able to glean a lot of information about her dragon-staff through the noises it made. She can tell when her wicks are running out of fuel, because as she spins, the whoosh of her
                                                      
134 Although most burners are not fire-spinners and fire-spinning is not unique to burns, it is a prevalent part of the culture and thus warrants a sound-centric analysis. Bowditch (2013), Clupper (2007), Gilmore (2010), and LadyBee (2007) and others have analyzed fire dance culture at Burning Man.

dragon-staff whipping around itself quiets down and she can hear more of the other sounds around her, such as the music playing or the crowd of people watching her. She can also tell when something is wrong. For example, she told me a story where this one time her and her friends accidentally mixed denatured alcohol and Coleman’s camp fuel:
[We] didn’t realize that our fuel dump had denatured alcohol in it and we topped it off with Coleman’s camp fuel. And it was popping and cracking and it was super obvious that something was wrong. Because of the sound it was making. It wasn’t making that “whoosh.” With denatured alcohol it’s a really quiet burn, you almost can’t hear anything. But it was this cracking and popping and it was less visual that cued me that something was wrong. Part of it was visual cause I knew that I was burning regular camp fuel and it was this really low low low flame that looked like denatured. But more so than that, when I first lit it, it POPPED. And it made this crazy noise and I knew immediately that something was up.
 Furthermore, when Tiger spins, she can tell where her dragon-staff is in space and uses this to guide her flow. The noise of her fire- spinning becomes a source of “zen” meditation. “I get really into the sound of my own stick,” she explains. “I like listening to it flip around my head and I pay more attention to that sound as my soundtrack, to whatever else is going on.”138 In my conversations with Jilly, another fire-

138 Tiger, intierview with author, April 1, 2017. 82
spinner, she agreed with Tiger, Pyrocelt, and Andrew’s statements about how sound has been an integral part of her fire-spinning learning process.
Throughout my fieldwork, I noticed numerous audial-related indicators of burners’ experience levels. Reactions to heckling and flame effects were, to me, the most obvious. However, there were others as well. For example, experienced participants tended to incorporate stories about their previous burn experiences and burn lingo, such as “TCO” and “MOOP,” into their speech.139 They also usually attached their cup and utensils onto a utility belt or sash and the sound of the clinking silverware could be heard whenever they walked, danced, or moved.140 (This sound is present in the background of many of my recordings.) Experienced burners also liked to share with me that they knew the sound of their own generator, even amongst the sounds of multiple generators running concurrently. Novak writes that “experiences of technological noise have become integral to contemporary sonic knowledges” and at a burn, this applies to generator soundså (2015, 130). In an interview at Frostburn 2016, “Camp Good Lay’s” TCO Pico explained to me:
I know the sound of my generator when it gets low on gas [or when something is wrong]. But I don’t know the sound of other people’s generators. I hear it and I’m like, uh, hmm, it’s about to die. And you look around the room like... okay who’s going to go fill it up?141
                                                      
139 Storytelling too is a mark of burners’ experience level. In conversation, burners love to share stories from their previous burn experiences, using them as a learning tool and as a way to relate to other participants. For deeper analysis, see Chen (2012b).
140 See sound-clip 64, partial explanation of the "Education Decathalon" and clinking utensils on a utility belt.
141 Pico, interview with author, February 13, 2016. 83
  
Sound then, even as simple as the clinking of silverware or the yelping of a surprised participant in response to a poofer, contains a depth of semiotic meaning that, to a careful listener, reveals much about burn subculture. Not only can sound be used as a locationary device in time and place at a burn, but also it can provide information about burn values, customs, and norms. I argue that aural ethnography and sound-centric analysis, in combination with traditional participant observation, can deepen ethnographers' understandings of the cultures they study. Furthermore, as I've shown throughout the work, audio recordings serve to contextualize the reader “in a manner that can intrigue and inform,” which as Makagon and Neumann remark, “is what any good ethnographic report seeks to accomplish” (2009, 21).

CHAPTER FOUR CONCLUSIONS Weaknesses of the Study Biases
As mentioned throughout my thesis, I had been a member of the burn community prior to beginning my research. Some scholars, such as ethnographer Michael Jackson, do not see this as problematic and stress the importance of removing the boundaries “between the observer and observed, between method and object” (1989, 3). While I agree with Jackson’s stance and recognize the importance of my “insider” knowledge, I also acknowledge the complications. In her book, Sweating Saris, Priya Srinivasan discusses the difficulties of choosing to conduct research in a place that feels like “home.” As an insider, the concepts of field-site and home-site become muddled. Like Srinivasan, during my research I was “an ‘insider’ in my own ‘home,’ disrupting the dichotomy of ‘field site’ and ‘home site,’ [and] destabilizing the notions of ‘insider’ [and] ‘outsider’” (2011, 19). My personal connections to and fondness of the burn community compromised my objectivity. As such, my own biases likely prevented negative connotations from seeping into my analyses.142
I am also troubled by the “bias of ethnographic recording,” discussed by sensory history scholar Mark Smith (2015, 58). Smith notes that:
Part of what we hear in recordings is an effort by those doing the recording to artifactualize a living culture. [...] For this reason, among others, [...recordings] tell us more about the values of those producing the recording than it does about the meaning of sounds uttered and heard (2015, 58).
                                                      
142 See Spencer 2017.
85
 
 
In my participant observation, I was the only one taking recordings. Though I tried to diversify my activities and patterns, what I spent my time doing and what I decided to record was still my own choice. Furthermore, the recordings I took at each burn reflect only my personal experience. In Smith’s eyes, does this lessen the potential academic use of my recordings? Smith questions the reproducibility of the senses and wonders “whether or not we can (or ought) to try to re-experience the auditory and sensate past” (2015, 60). While I am inclined to disagree with Smith and defend the importance of incorporating audio-clips into ethnographies, he does raise some legitimate concerns about the biases of my ethnographic recordings.
Study Design Issues
In addition to the biases discussed above, there were a few study design issues that I wish to bring to attention. First, in hindsight I should have registered Thesis Camp as a theme camp with its own placement for Transformus. Because Thesis Camp was located within a larger theme camp, Phart Camp, it had considerably fewer visitors. Second, I worry that because I have not attended the larger Burning Man event in Nevada, that some burners and scholars may outright deem my opinions invalid. Third, my original research questions were far too broad, and as a result, I ended up with far more data than I knew what to do with.143 The data became overwhelming and I spent a great deal of time organizing it all. There was so much I wanted to say, but finding a way
                                                      
143 In my submitted plan to the IRB, my research questions were: “what does a burn sound like?”; “what sounds are integral to the burn soundscape—regardless of where or when it takes place?”; “how do regional burn soundscapes differ from one another?”; “how are soundscapes utilized by regional burn participants?”; and “what can
be learned about the urn subculture by honing in on soundscapes?”
  
86
to connect and include it all was difficult. Once I chose my goals, however, this overabundance of data proved not only helpful, but also necessary. The recordings, soundscape suggestion binder, and comment cards helped me find examples to substantiate my theories. Fourth, I did not get as many formal post-burn interviews as I wanted. Crafting unbiased interview questions about how one uses and experiences sound was more problematic than I anticipated. Any time I tried, it felt like my questions served to help me prove my already established hypotheses. Luckily during my fieldwork, I was constantly talking to people at the burns and informally interviewing them on site. Furthermore, I continued to talk to burn participants via Facebook after the burns were over. I dug deep into my recordings, collected data, field-notes, and post- burn Facebook conversations to look for in-the-moment genuine participant reactions.
Fifth, I worried what was missing: not just physically, I obviously could not be everywhere at one, but mentally. I was only one person—a cis-gender white woman from an upper-middle class background nonetheless—in my own head, understanding the burn around me as I perceived it. This realization hit me hard at PDF when a participant left an anonymous comment card in Thesis Camp:
I offer you a different perspective of the recording you took Thursday night at the sign-in tent: While you were enjoying the rambunctiousness of the greeter-volunteers, I as someone coming in hated it as I was mislabeled many times from “she” to “lesbian,” which was displeasing as a gender fluid queer. Some of my male friends were also labeled as such to their unhappiness. I feel that a lot goes unheard and unsaid, as the people who feel less able to speak up, [such as] quieter folk prone to listening, do not get or perhaps feel able to take the chance to talk. Look at me writing rather than speaking.144
                                                      
144 Sound-clip 70, a rambunctious gate crew, audio taken at PDF, October 6, 2016 at 9:45pm.
  
87
Upon reading this, my heart sunk. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I consider myself versed in current issues surrounding gender and sexuality. Yet in this case, the anonymous commenter was totally right. I had a huge smile plastered to my face while I watched and listened to the gate crew work. In my skin, their heckling felt safe, akin to the way good friends poke fun at each other. To me, the inappropriate playful banter of the gate crew was a familiar part of the burn experience, a part of hecklers’ “radical self- expression.”145 In this case, the PDF gate crew hecklers offended some participants by mislabeling their genders and calling out their (wrongly attributed) sexual preferences. But because no one voiced their offense aloud, this perspective went right over my head. I wonder: what else did I fail to notice? By extension, what do sound-centric studies, like my own, fail to hear? Who and what is silenced, and what are the implications of this silence? Finally, what can ethnographers and scholars with sound-centric approaches do to better heed and discuss silences?146
Technological, Weather, and Structural Issues
At four out of the seven burns—Wickerman, Firefly, Transformus, and POrtalburn—my binaural microphones broke. On Friday afternoon at Wickerman, the
                                                      
145 In my interview with Pyrocelt, he indicated that heckling was one of his favorite parts about the burn culture.
146 Jonathan Stern wrote that “scholars of speech, hearing, and sound seem largely ignorant of the cultural work on deafness” (2003, 346). Mara Mills notes that still, twelve years later, only “a few authors [herself included] have centered deafness in their accounts” (2015, 52). My thesis, like the vast majority of sound studies scholarship, does not address deafness. Furthermore, though race, class, gender, and sexuality are, at the core, underlying every culture, I was not able to deeply analyze how these components connect to my thesis topic.
 
 88
right microphone suddenly stopped registering sound. I did not have a back-up pair and resorted to using a microphone that came with the recorder; luckily the weather was beautiful and I could do this. Upon returning home from Wickerman, I sent the broken microphones back to the seller and was sent a new pair. (The microphones were under warranty.) However, I could not afford to purchase a back-up pair and was very nervous that something similar would happen at Firefly. My fears were almost realized on Thursday at Firefly. While taking a recording of the gate check-in process, I realized that the microphones were only periodically picking up sound. A nearby Firefly participant, an electrical engineer in default world, heard me voicing my concerns and offered to help me. Luckily the issue was a loose connection inside the cable near the eighth-inch jack. He braced the cord with a pencil and wrapped it in electrical tape; the connection held and the microphones worked for the remainder of the weekend. After Firefly, I was able to afford a second pair of microphones. However, at Transformus, both of the microphones had trouble correctly reading sound. The decibel readings for the first pair popped between extreme highs and lows for no reason that I could fathom. In the second pair, one of the microphones was registering sounds three times more sensitively than the other. Transformus’ on and off rain made it unsafe for me to use a different mic source. After Transformus, I sent both pairs of microphones in for repair and was gifted a third pair as an apology. At POrtalburn, I had a sensitivity issue with one of the pairs of microphones, but by then I had two backup pairs. My research continued without any glitches. I did not have any technological issues at PDF or Alchemy, but I was also treating my equipment much more carefully.

Although an anticipated possibility, inclement weather was an issue for my technology and my set-up. In rainy conditions, I wore a clear hooded poncho to shield my recorder and microphones. The microphones were protected by my ears as well as
the hood. I could even safely write field-notes in my journal from under the body of the poncho. (See Figure 13.) This technique worked great during the warm rains at Firefly. (Although the rain pattering on my crinkling poncho can be heard in every rainy recording.)147 However, as I discovered Saturday night at PDF, the inside of the poncho condensates during cold weather. I was able to
record “the pony” burn, but shortly after needed to put my technology and journal away; the inside of my poncho was as wet as the outside. At PDF, Saturday’s incessant rains caused the grounds to turn into mushy
wetlands, so much so that both of my tent’s ground stakes lifted up out of the ground.148

 The opposite occurred at Alchemy a week
later. The southern drought had caused the
ground to become rock hard, bending my tent
stakes. (See Figure 14.) Also at PDF, the
inside of my food bin (which was supposed to
be waterproof, but apparently had a cracked
lid) flooded, turning all of my opened food into
mush at the bottom of the bin. (I like to joke
that the granola had a transformative burn
experience and turned itself into oatmeal.)
Winds were another issue at PDF and Alchemy.
At PDF, one of Thesis Camp’s tent poles split
due to the tension the wind was placing on it. As a result, the sharp wood caused a tear in the tent’s rain fly. I made a temporary patch out of Gorilla tape, but this wasn’t enough to hold it during the high winds at Alchemy. There, half of Thesis Camp collapsed. Large hunks of time were dedicated to problem solving and weather-related damage control. Sunday at PDF, with tears streaming down my face, I lamented missing out on fieldwork opportunities until I realized that this was the fieldwork opportunity. Everyone was up to their elbows in mud. Most events had been cancelled or postponed and many participants and theme camps decided to leave early. Instead of fighting it, I decided to embrace it as an authentic burn experience.
“There’s no such thing as bad weather, there’s just weather,” Monty remarked in
a conversation about Transformus’ and Frostburn’s tough conditions. “And from what

I’ve seen, regardless of the weather, people are going to do the same thing they planned on doing anyway.” To him, tricky weather is part of the burn, noting that “if it was easy, everyone would do it.”149 Difficult situations, such as inclement weather, also serve as community building exercises. As one PDF participant explained:
While it was really muddy and gross it brought us all together and helped us work together. It was really nice to see everyone out in the parking lot [where cars were stuck in the mud] helping each other out. It was a nice community building experience for everybody which was really neat to watch. Everybody just helped everyone else get out and make sure everyone is safe and bring everybody a little bit closer together.150
I had experienced this sentiment first hand on a variety of occasions. During my puffy- eyed moment at PDF, a burner named Woad stopped in her tracks to help me clean out my messy flooded food bin. In a conversation with Boston regional burner Zephyr, we both shared stories about our tough time walking in our camping equipment at Firefly. At Firefly, only four-wheel and all-wheel drive vehicles are permitted to drive on the pathways and when it rains, no vehicles are permitted. Most participants walk their gear in using hand-carts up a giant hill with windy, uneven ground nonetheless.151 This year during the already difficult load-in, it poured. I explained to Zephyr a story about how a participant named Wren (a stranger to me at the time), saw me struggling and helped me carry a heavy cooler all the way to my campsite at the top of the hill. “That’s like, rite of

initiation for Firefly,” said Zephyr. “That’s the thing. Everybody knows about it and we’re all watching each other. It’s a very intense load-in, but [everyone’s] very supportive. The shared experience of load-in and load-out at Firefly is kind of a bonding moment.”152 My broken tent at Alchemy was ultimately fixed, thanks to the help of Seth and Charles, two handy burners from neighboring theme camp “Camp Pretty Lights.” In short, though my technological and weather-related issues were not by any means fun, they did provide insight into the burn values of “participation” and “communal effort” and helped me make some friends along the way.
Recommendations for Future Research
I accidentally discovered something interesting while listening back on my burn
soundscape recordings. As discussed in the "Technology" section, my binaural microphones capture a 360-degree stereo atmosphere: what is in front of me, behind me, to the left and right of me, above me, below me, and what is near and far away. As I listen, I instantly, unintentionally picture my past visual perspective in my head and remember how I was feeling in that moment, be it hungry, cranky, intrigued, or any emotional/physical combination. My audio recordings allow me to relive that moment of my body in that place. I wonder about the implications of this feeling. There is something very curious happening here; a strong connection between my aural experiences and my sensory memory, more than what I experience when I look at a picture or watch a video. Interestingly, the embodied feeling I feel when listening to these recordings has also applied to when other burners listen to them as well. Back at

home, burners who knew about my project would sometimes ask me if I could send them a particular recording (which they were usually in). Upon listening to a recording in which she was in, Babydoll immediately responded: “OMG this is fabulous brought me right back that moment. Amazing.”153 In person, at five of the seven burns I attended, I experimented by playing sound-clips (of the burn they were currently attending) to participants. As soon as the headphones were on and the recording began to play, almost all of the burners had identical reactions. Their heads perked up, their eyes lit up, and their mouths gaped open wide as they looked to the left and right, realizing that the sounds they were hearing were not actually present. “I feel like I’m right there!” they’d exclaim, before excitedly trying to guess where/when the recording took place, and what moment the recording was intended to capture. More than often they would get it right. One burner, Jenny, subconsciously shifted her body around as she listened, as though trying to move out of the way of passer-bys in the recording. Watching these reactions, I couldn’t help but be reminded of a few articles I read for my graduate coursework about mirror neurons, “synaptic connections in the cortex that fire both when one sees an action and when one does that action” (Foster 2010, 1). Musician and theorist Arnie Cox (2011) claims that mirror neurons fire in people’s brains when they watch or listen to music. Is it really so far-fetched to presume that mirror neurons activate with sound as well? Furthermore, what are the implications of the sound-body-memory connection? Though I cannot offer any concrete hypotheses at this moment, I implore the the sound studies community to further explore the “why?” behind this curious discovery.

It would also be interesting to place continuously recording decibel meters (not microphones for consent reasons) in different areas of the burn. These decibel meters would capture overall loudness levels as noise fluctuates over time. Is there such a thing as time-lapse “audiography”? I would be very intrigued to see how sound maps out visually at a burn—when and where sounds become louder and softer. These graphs would serve to corroborate or disprove my own, Moore and Smallwood’s hypotheses about how the overall noise of the burn progresses each day and throughout the week. This type of noise mapping could be applied to many areas on a larger scale, graphing the patterns of people, animals, and more.
If I were to continue my research, I would begin coding my data using a qualitative data analysis application like NVivo. NVivo allows users to import, manage, and analyze text, audio, video, images, spreadsheets, web pages, and social media websites. The application helps researches organize, categorize, look through, and visualize their data. NVivo could help corroborate or disprove my hypotheses, as well as provide me with new insights and help me discover connections in my data that I would not have seen otherwise.
Finally, because of time and length constraints, I was not able to delve into deep analysis on how burn values, such as the ten principles, are reflected in the soundscape. A further study on burn values, rooted in linguistic anthropology and sound studies, is needed.
Future Intentions
Throughout my participant observation and afterwards on social media websites,
a great deal of burners asked me what I planned to do with my collection of sound-clips.
 
95
Many expressed their interest in searching through them for nostalgic reasons. Others, such as DJs, sound artists, and one animator, asked me to collaborate with them for future burn projects. These burners foresaw the creative ways in which the recordings could be rendered, integrating the sounds of previous burns into their craft. I was not only flattered by their interest, but also exhilarated by the prospects. After my thesis is published, I intend to offer up my collection as a gift to the burn community. It will be time consuming, but I plan to slowly edit and upload the sound-clips to an online database. I also hope to get in touch and work with interested musical and mixed- medium artists.
Furthermore, the performativity of this document, in its current form, is limited by the requirements set forth by Temple University's graduate school and as a result is not formatted in a way that fosters the sense of play that the sound-clips and content warrant. When I originally envisioned the final form that this project would take, I imagined something in line with the creative, hands-on art I fell in love with at burns. Shortly after my submittal to Temple University and ProQuest, I plan to create an interactive website that will showcase my research and the sound-clip database mentioned above.

APPENDIX A ANDREW J. INTERVIEW
Informant Description and Transcription of Notable Dialogue
My first interview was with a first time burner named Andrew. I met Andrew, a
twenty-six-year-old male, at Firefly 2016. I chose to interview Andrew because of his distinct perspective on the sounds of Firefly. Andrew is “totally blind” (0:54) and has been so his entire life. He was born with a rare congenital eye condition called “Leber’s,” in which the photo receptor cells of his retina, which “translate what you see into code in your brain” (15:50) were damaged or killed in utero. Andrew can “see light—brightness and darkness—but no color or shape or shadow” (16:04) and uses a cane in order to get around. Andrew and I spoke via FaceTime on March 6, 2017. After ensuring that the camera was, in fact, pointing at his face, as opposed to his “ceiling” or his “chest,” (1:04) and receiving verbal consent from Andrew, we began the interview. The interview lasted one hour, four minutes and thirty-four seconds.
RER (4:35):
AJ (4:46):
How/when did you find out about Burning Man, and by extension, Firefly? Or was it the other way around, Firefly, and then Burning Man? That’s a good question. I guess I was made aware of both at around the same time I moved to Boston in 2013 and just the friends circle that I happened to have already there, as well as the new friends that I made in Boston were in the scene and familiar with burns and all went to Firefly and stuff like that.
What did you know about Firefly or burn culture, prior to arriving?
107
RER (5:27):
 
AJ (5:34):
I knew that the culture was inclusive and collaborative and I knew about the “ten principles of Burning Man” and I knew to a certain extent that Firefly was a party in the woods and that people brought their art and their self expression there and some of the basic things like music and fire and food, etc. But there’s being told about something and then there’s experiencing it. I definitely only had a basic idea of what I going to experience that week.
So Firefly was your first burn... what were some of your favorite aspects about it?
It’s very hard picking them out from the gestalt that was the whole experience of the forest alive. But I think some of them were the kind of attitude that everyone brought there, the open-ness, the lack of inhibition, in the big ways, but also like in the small ways, how everyone interacted and talked. If you wanted the farthest fucking thing from the Boston city streets, it would be the paths in that forest. The music everywhere was pretty amazing and just the level of art and construction that went into this place... I had no idea that such a project was possible. This “leave no trace” project that came and went in less than ten days.
What was most challenging to you?
Definitely being blind. Like, that is definitely one of the hardest places to not be able to see shit. I don’t think I could have gone without my girlfriend being there and also being the particular kind of awesome that
she is, where she was willing to spend all of her time with me and not get 108

distracted by other shit. I don’t know, it was nice, not feeling like I was imposing on people’s fun, which I think I would have, if I had gone with anyone else.
Do you have any memories or stories that particularly stick out to you? Plenty of awesome things happened. The best ones that lend themselves to stories were the random surprises we would find. There was a day, because of too much excitement, we forgot to eat all day and pretty much the second we realized at midnight, we rounded a corner and there was this lady with a giant raclette cart, so just like a giant melting wheel of melting cheese, and some people by a fire cooking up potatoes. So we had this delicious food ready to hand right when we decided we were hungry. A thousand of those tiny little moments of serendipity that were just really, really cool. It was cool being able to do that for other people as well.
Do you remember how you found out about Thesis Camp?
I do. I remember. I met you with my partner somewhere on a path and I don’t remember the details of it... so don’t feel bad.
No, now that I see your face, I remember meeting you too, but I don’t remember how it happened.
I remember meeting you and you told us about it and we were like “oh that’s cool, we would love to be a part of it and help out.” And, of course, my girlfriend turned to me and she was like “you’re going to be perfect!

RER (19:59): AJ (20:30):
You’re blind—you’re exactly what she’s looking for, you better do this.” And I was like “okay, sure.”
How did you navigate your environment at Firefly?
Definitely a challenging environment and for the most part, one that I couldn’t do alone. It would just be impractical. There were paths through the woods and stuff but there were all sorts of impediments. If I was doing serious hiking, what I would do is bring two hiking poles and those you can use to feel the ground in front of you, so that’s a little helpful. Mostly I just walked with my partner and stepped high and wore boots the whole time. It just made the walking around a lot easier and a little more forgiving on the rocks and stumps and stuff. But it was definitely challenging. I guess it would have been a little easier if it was open ground and stuff, but still there’s the knowing where you’re going part. Sidewalks and streets and laid out places like that have a lot more landmarks that make it easy to get around.
In the (Thesis Camp sound suggestion) book, you said that you were “on the lookout for sounds,” so I’m interested in hearing more about what you meant by that—could you elaborate? [Andrew laughs as I quote him.] Well, I mean, it’s a very unusual environment and place, right? There are no cars, I don’t think I even heard any planes, or anything. So all of the ambient sounds are different cause you’re in the woods. But then, the next exponent up from that is everything that’s going on in the woods. I mean,
the most basic part of that, is, of course, eavesdropping. Listening to all of 110
RER (22:17):
AJ (22:32):
 
RER (24:13):
AJ (24:43):
RER (25:05):
the conversations and what people are talking about around you. And then the sounds of say, fire props for instance... all the different props and all their different sounds, like fan versus sword versus poi, etc. And the music and what different sonic spaces are created...the discordant overlapping beats you hear as you walk down these quiet forest pathways... or the little changes in sound from when you’re out in that big field to suddenly under all these big trees and everything gets a little more quiet and still and you can hear the stream passing you. All the differences, really, between the sounds.
Rose was one-hundred percent right. I’m very, very grateful that you went into my tent! I’ve been thinking these things, and I don’t know, it’s making me very happy to talk to somebody who one-hundred-percent gets it.
Yeah, its one of those things... I feel like most people, they don’t know what their brain does. It’s something that I’ve found that most people are very unconscious of, how sound affects their lives.
So I realize that Firefly was a long time ago now, but I’m wondering if you could take a listen to some sound-clips that I sent and tell me what you hear in them? Everything goes and nothing is too small and again there’s no right or wrong answers. But I’m wondering what you would get out of these clips.
[Andrew takes a few minutes to get the sound-clips downloaded and
organized. He types away quickly and I wonder about how his computer 111
AJ:
 
RER (34:20): AJ (34:43):
is organized, and what he is hearing in his headphones that I cannot. As the files download, we chit-chat about how my project is going, what burns we both intend to do this summer, and his interest in going to Burning Man next summer.]
Yeah, let’s start with [sound-clip 75.]154
[Andrew laughs.] I feel like this was recorded in the field. I can’t tell the time of day, but I like the birds and whoever was screaming in the woods. Day time sounds. It definitely brought me right back there. I think even if you hadn’t told me that that was a Firefly clip, I would have been able to hear that. [It was actually recorded on a path in the woods in front of a piece of sound-art that played recorded bird songs when you walked by.] You say it brought you right back there... I know it’s hard to talk about how we each perceive sound and touch and smell and everything, it’s hard to say what something smells like, but what about it sounded like Firefly or brought you right back there?
It was... well partly it was the birds. Whatever those birds were have imprinted into my mind... summer sun on my skin. I don’t know, it was just a memory of place. You know, and actually the empty space too that you caught in the microphones, not only the sound of them, but the sound of them in that space... the way that it echoed made me think of that environment.

Very cool. Alright, let’s try the next one. So for this one Andrew, it’s like three and a half minutes long, so just start the clip and play for forty-five seconds-ish or something, until you’re like “yeah I got it” and just stop. Cause it’s too long.155
Alright, here we go. This is a cool sound. I don’t think I sound anything like this in particular when I was there... I mean, I heard the fire, obviously, but this seems like much more of a solemn fire. Was this temple?
Mmhmm! Yeah! Did you guys stay through Sunday?
Yeah, I was DJ-ing right after the temple burn, so I was back at “Lions” being really loud and obnoxious.
Gotcha. I was very pleased to catch this clip. I actually found myself crying and crying and trying not to cry too loudly while this was happening, because my microphones were in my eyes, so whenever I talk in a recording, it sounds very very close. But yeah, it was at the temple. How did you gauge that it was that specific fire, of all the fires that had gone on that weekend?
Um, well, part of it was the music that was going along with it, the woman singing. It just seemed a lot more solemn. But even before that... the sound of the fire. I don’t know if they built it differently but, god, the sound of the bug burning, I don’t know... it pounded at you, that fire. It

was just wild and strong and powerful... whereas this was quiet and subdued and controlled. I don’t know. They must have built it differently because it was a much more calm and peaceful sound.
This is [sound-clip 77]. 156 [Andrew laughs and his face lights up.] What is that? Like a saw? I actually don’t remember this. Things that I heard. Huh! Well, that is the first one that didn’t trigger any personal memories or thoughts, really.
I was wondering when you guys got there, when did you arrive on site? Yeah, ‘cause I was going to say... it sounds like someone building something. It was a very artificial sound. I’m glad I didn’t hear much of that.
That was Wednesday. That was actually “The Lions Den” [Andrew’s theme camp] being built.
A drill! That’s what it was. We got there Wednesday, but most of the stage had been built at that point. Yeah, sorry, I don’t really have much more to say about that one.
No, that’s fine! Building sounds, that’s totally all it was!
This is [sound-clip 78]. 157 Aw how polite. [Laughs at the sound-clip.] Oh! Was this Friday when it was raining?

That’s great! I mean, when have you heard people outside in the rain, being all that calm?
This is [sound-clip 56].158 Oh... oh... I think I know what this is going to be. Oh wait, no. [Chuckles.] Oh, what was that thing? I heard that sound a lot and I sort of associated it with the giant lamp that shot fire out of itself, but I think it was another thing. It was like, a ring toss or something?
Yeah! That’s exactly what it was actually. A fire poofing ring toss. This art piece that had gone out or was being prepared to go out to Burning Man or something.
That’s right. I remember that. I remember that it happened, but I swear to god, I’m not remembering any of these other than the sounds that they make, obviously.

did you gather that you knew where I was or what I was experiencing in that moment?
Ohh... so... the easy ones right are like the people commenting on it, right? You can hear that there’s a big group of people watching this event. Either one or maybe a couple people, I couldn’t tell, taking throws, you know? So like, the sound ebbs and flows with the crowd and whether or not someone makes a good throw or not. So sometimes there’s one noise which is the ring hitting the metal, but then, you know if there was a successful one, that there was that also shrieking and squeaking and what I’m assuming was flame coming out of it. That soundscape, you could tell that it was outside from the way that people voices didn’t bounce around, you know... the ambience of it. You could tell that there was a giant metal thing. I don’t know, it put me right there.
That’s so cool! I mean, for me. I don’t know if its cool for you. [Andrew and I laugh together.]
Yeah... it feels like showing off!
Uno mas... okay. This is [sound-clip. 29]159 Huh! I’m guessing that was a night-time one that you took, in a field, maybe? Listening to the ambient sounds of the forest. You could hear some people screaming. The sounds of the echoes of the music—very, very little of it. Whatever came out from the trees. And just the sounds of people having a good time very,

very far away from you. I’m guessing you did that by the bug on Saturday night? [The sound-clip was actually from Wednesday. By Saturday, this spot was considerably louder and had an aural soup-like quality, from the many different sound camps playing different music in the distance, as opposed to just the one.]
There was this field that ran along the side of the event from upper parking lot towards the main pathway that would get you up to “Axiom” and stuff. [Andrew sharply inhales as he registers exactly where I’m talking about.]
I think I was just standing in that big open field right next to parking. It was very similarly shaped to where the bug was, in that it was a big open field on the outskirts of trees.
It was actually a cool clip cause the guy near you gave it a sense of scope... you know. Like him, as opposed to the other sounds of fun far away. It informed where you were as opposed to where everything else is... It’s like what I imagine scale on a map is. One guy equals ten feet, or whatever.
It was definitely at night. How did you know that it was at night?
No animal sounds. It was quiet. It sounded dark. That place was so alive with bugs and birds and whatever, and all of those were just silent... it was just the sound of the still night air and crickets.
Do you think you can tell where you are in a burn, solely based on sounds?
117
AJ (54:00):
RER (54:44): AJ (54:52):
RER (56:02):
 
AJ (56:09):
Oh yeah, absolutely. It was less precise, but it was also in a way more accurate to my internal experience than my watch. I wear a watch to tell the time but I hardly looked at it unless it was DJ set times. But apart from that, I used sound even more so than the little light that I can see to know what was going on, where I was, and what time it was. It was very interesting and cool. I noticed that independently.
Was it more so that way at a burn, than say, your normal day-to-day life? Yes, absolutely. Deciding precisely why is complicated. There are a couple factors. One is because in my day to day life I have a phone all the time, so I’m always looking at the time. So in the same way that a lot of people don’t notice sound, to you, which I assume is because vision is more dominant, I think it’s the same way with all of the tech and places where the time and location is visible... clocks and street signs and google maps, what have you, alarms. We have all of these artificial systems to tell us about these things and they’re not personalized to us. We don’t decide when its 5:00, for instance... but in the woods all you have is the sun to go on, so if you don’t want to have a watch with you, you orient yourself to the sounds around you. And also the sounds of the city where I live don’t really change that often... cars, trucks... you could tell in some houses, not mine, by what’s on TV. Maybe that’s a way for people to tell the time. But the activity of the city does not so markedly change, maybe nightclubs or whatever when it’s dark out. But it’s a lot less noticeable
than in the woods, or specifically at the burn. 118
RER (57:05): AJ (57:13):
 
RER (59:15):
AJ (59:46):
At the burn then, what types of clues, what were some markers for you, that helped you tell when you were, whether it was day-by-day or time of day?
Um... day-by-day things kind of escalated. But there was a general flavor of things. Like, there was more conversation during the days and as the day wore on the conversation would slowly be eclipsed by music starting to play, more sounds of people getting into the circles and spinning fire, for instance. The many enclaves of conversations you’d run into sort of dissolved away into people dancing and breaking away a little bit more into other things as the day wore on. But also the sounds of the animals would change... what you hear from the environment. I don’t know, even the sound of the wind through the trees when it gets dark just feels different. Maybe there is a clue, maybe the light and dark plays a part in that, but I just feel like the night sounded different too. It’s hard to separate a general feeling into its constituent parts.
RER (1:01:37): Did Thursday sound different from Friday or Saturday or Sunday to you?
AJ (1:01:45):
Oh yeah, absolutely. I wasn’t able to focus on the differences between Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I’m sure they existed and they felt very different to me. (...) Even the kinds of music, the excitement, and the energy that people brought, even day to day was very different. Friday was different from Saturday was different from Sunday, but I couldn’t tell you what changed in the sound, but it did.

APPENDIX B PYROCELT INTERVIEW
Informant Description and Transcription of Notable Dialogue
My second interview was with a veteran burner named Pyrocelt. Pyrocelt and I
met at my first Transformus in 2014 and continued to stay in touch through social media and other regional burns, such as Frostburn. This burn season, while I was completing my fieldwork, Pyrocelt and I happened to attend three of the same regional burns— Wickerman, Transformus, and Alchemy. It quickly became clear to me that Pyrocelt would be a prime candidate to interview for my research. Pyrocelt began burning in 2005 and has attended somewhere “between two dozen and less than four dozen” (8:19) burns in that time, including Transformus 2005-2016, Alchemy 2007-2016, Frostburn 2016, Wickerman 2016, Burning Man 2007 and 2015, and more. He is a flame effects artist, as well as a TCO and coordination team lead for Transformus. We spoke via FaceTime on March 30, 2017, while he was on a layover at JFK airport. Pyrocelt is one of Burning Man’s regional contacts (RCs) for North Carolina and was on his way to the Burning Man Global Leadership Conference. The interview lasted one hour, eleven minutes and thirty-two seconds.
RER (8:24): PC (8:32):
How would you compare Burning Man to regional burns?
They’re totally different events. I often say to people who are at regionals that the experience you have the first time you’re at a regional burn and you’re like “Oh my god, this is so big and crazy, how the hell does it all come together and exist?” You have the same experience the first time you go to Burning Man, even if you’ve been running a team for a long
120
 
RER (9:51): PC (9:57):
time. You got a good idea of how it all works and how it makes sense, but you go to Burning Man and you’re overwhelmed by the fact that there’s 70,000 people and structures at a scale that’s un-comparable to anywhere else on this planet. [...] Size and scale, it’s a big difference. It’s also a place where you may meet a person you’ll never see again. Even if they tell you “I’m at Camp So-and-So,” how often are they actually at their camp?
Which do you prefer, after all these years?
Well, I’m a poor southerner so regionals by far because I can actually access them. If you live close to Burning Man, you can drive, but if you don’t, it’s going to cost at least as much as a small laptop, probably $2000. Regionals are a lot less expensive. You can get away with a regional for a few hundred dollars if you already have camping equipment. Not that people do, I mean, at some point running a theme camp, I realized I was spending one to two thousand dollars on the burns. But that doesn’t mean you have to.
You and I were having a conversation at Alchemy and I regret turning off my microphone because you said something that really resonated with me and it seemed like something that had been practiced. Which is why I reached out to you, to see if you could say it again. How would you describe it?
I call it my burner creation myth spiel. My version of how these things all
come together... [He pauses to take a breath.] What is a burn? You know 121
RER (10:42):
PC (11:23):
 
 
you go to a burn and there’s all those crazy freedoms happening there. There are a bunch of people who are there to get drunk at all the free bars and that’s awesome, there are free bars and that’s a good thing to do. But it’s not just a drinking event, you know? There are ravers there who are going to house camp to house camp having their great fun times that little ravers do. But it’s definitely not just a rave. And there’s the six A.M. yoga kids there doing yoga at six o’clock in the morning. But it’s definitely not just yoga camp. And there’s the AA meetings that happen at burns. Which is probably not close to any AA retreat that you’d picture. And there’s the BDSM crew who are having their weird, strange, kinky sex. But it’s not just a kink event. So what holds it all together? In my version of the world, and I’m a little biased about this, everything is held together by the fire dancers. Fire dancers are kind of like hippies. They dress in really pretty lovely clothes and are nice to look at. A little tribal. But hippies are inherently weak. You know, you see a hippie in an alley at night and some kids might make fun of them. Fire dancers? Not weak. They have a big chain and a ball of fire on it and they’re swinging it around. You’re not going to make fun of them. They’re kind of like punks—a little tough. But punks are a little tough. You don’t want to stare at them too long or they’ll come beat you up. They wouldn’t beat me up because the hippies and the punks get along pretty well. But they would beat up normals and squares. But fire dancers are supposed to be
watched. It’s a performance—you’re supposed to look at it. So in that 122
RER (14:39):
PC (15:10):
way they’re kind of like the circus clowns. You’re supposed to go out and stare at them. [...] But what brings us all together in the end is that we’re all some kind of deviation from the norm. We all recognize that we’re all deviations from the norm and create a safe space to explore your deviation, even if its not my deviation. So the ravers can rave. And the alcoholics can drink. And the kinksters can kink and whatever else you want to do. In a real way, in our culture, we’re all inherently deviants. That’s how capitalism helps us to buy more things: you’re too fat, or you’re too thin, you’re too tall, or too short. Buy that product, or that thing over there. Maybe she’s born with it, or maybe it’s Maybelline. It’s a place where we can be safe in our esoterities and our abnormalicies and our deviations.
What I’m hearing is that a burn creates a safe space for many different types of people or interests to come together and somehow create a community out of that. Is that what does it for you?
For me personally it’s about exploring extremes. I like to explore extremes: how can I make that ball of fire bigger or take something further? Burns have a good way of doing that and yet also have a built in safety net where we take care of ourselves, even if we’re different from each other.
In thinking about your experience at regional burns, can you describe how their sounds are similar or different?
123
RER (19:25):
 
PC (19:42):
I’m more than a little bit involved in organizing burns. And one of the things that shuts burns down across the country is the problem of neighbors and sounds. So I’m keenly aware of sounds. Different burns have different levels of safety involving that. Transformus had historically happened at a place called Deerfields where they have one valley where you can have the biggest sound systems you want. There are 18,000-watt sound systems there. And multiple eight, ten, and twelve- thousand-watt sound systems. These are big fucking sound systems that cannot be heard from the neighbors. The county does have sound ordinances but because the brothers own close to 1,000 acres up at the top of the mountain with a valley on each side you couldn’t hear the sounds outside that valley. That’s one place where sound is very intense and very driving and very fun. Other burns have a lot more problems with that kind of thing. Burns in Florida where everything is flat have had real issues mitigating that kind of noise. Alchemy [GA] one year, my tent was set up about thirty feet from six LABS speakers which is a specific speaker system designed by a man who worked with NASA to levitate foam balls based on conflicting sound waves. [...] So from where we were camped, you could move your mouth and it would modulate sound inside your mouth without adding any sound yourself. It was very unpleasant if you were trying to sleep. The mattresses were literally shaking under us... you could feel the vibrations in the air mattresses. [...] In the end, the police
rammed the front gate. Usually the cops on site, that’s not a good sign. 124
 
RER (25:42):
PC (26:12):
But then the ridiculously obnoxious sound system shut down and all of the tents around started clapping. It was kind of funny. [...] So yeah, noise at burns is tricky.
As someone who has planned regional burns before, how do you consider sound during the planning process?
So basically there’s not a lot of regulations on site. It’s kind of an anarchistic event. It’s also kind of a freedom utopia event. People have described it as “better than heaven,” “these are all the things I’d want in my life, I can’t believe they’re all here.” That being said people have different things they want in their little patch of heaven. And as someone who has the ability to lay out and organize in advance, we try to give people similar things around them. So people that really like food, that’s cool... put a couple of food camps together. And that will be a great place I will go to to eat my food because it’s delicious. Likewise, we have adult neighborhoods that have all the kinky fet things going on there. [...] And as I said, a lot of what the philosophy at burns is, is letting you express your artistic freedom, even if its not my thing at all. Like-wise if you like big fuckin’ asshole loud sound systems we have a place for you. And we’ll put you together with your friends and if your friends trounce you, bring a bigger sound system next year. [We both laugh.] Sometimes it works out like magic and sometimes its just like bass diarrhea. As somebody who places camps, sometimes it’s really tricky.
125
 
RER (28:48):I know for that particular event you’re talking about, I don’t know of people walking around with decibel readers, but I know that it does happen. Like at Alchemy this year, there were sound ordinances. In your experience, is that common?
PC (29:29):
So Transformus doesn’t have sound ordinances per-se. [...] That being said, we do want to camp people with like-minded camps. So if camps fuck up or were playing music way too loud in neighborhoods where they shouldn’t be, the theme camp placement moves them into the loud neighborhood next year. We’d squeeze them in-between two huge sound camps and they would just be crushed. That’s how it goes with big sound camps. We only have so many places for it. [...] Some people were very unhappy when they got moved but it makes us all happier in the end. [...] The way that, for a long time, the Florida burns dealt with it was they would have a decibel meter a hundred feet back from the DJ booth. And it was linked up to lights—red, green, and yellow. Little lights on a pole. And it was usually green. And if someone who was on the sound team came by and and checked your decibels from that hundred-foot post and you were too loud, they would click it to yellow. If you got a red light, your stage would shut down for the night. And if you got a second red light, your entire camp was thrown off site. They didn’t fuck around with this. They’d come back in an hour and check it again. If you were under the right amount of noise, they’d put it back to green. This is a pretty
good way to keep camps pretty well under control and give them a way to 126
 
see what was happening without actually having to go up and talk to them. Because talking to DJs and arguing with them while they’re DJing is kinda tricky. This way a DJ could look at something, it was a visual cue and it was really obvious—you’re too loud. [Pyrocelt then told me an additional story about how one team lead at PDF came up with a supportive and effective way to control decibel levels for sound camps. In this model, the sound ordinance team (dubbed “the buzzkills”) fostered a positive relationship with sound camps from day one, spending time with each camp and getting to know them. Throughout the weekend, the buzzkills, dressed in bumble bee outfits, would take decibel readings of each camp. Because the sound ordinance team and the sound camps respected each other, the sound camps were happy to oblige with the rules.]
RER (37:03): So far what has seemed to come up are noise levels that have to do with music and DJs, specifically. I’m wondering if you could talk more about general sounds—people sounds, or the sound of the burn, from beginning to end.
PC (37:43): The burn probably follows a more specific arc throughout the day, depending on how much activity is happening here or there. There’s kind of morning activities and afternoon buzzes and a funny lull before night where everyone is probably cooking before it gets all heated up again after dark and people are going until god knows when. Fire is a sound that’s always hilarious. I find you can tell people who are experienced burners
 
from people who have not been to a burn before when large flame effects 127
RER (39:15):
PC (39:22):
go off. They are concerned and humans have a real genetic predisposition to be afraid of fire, for pretty good survival reasons. [...] As humans in caves we were really designed to watch the fire—is it out?; do we put more wood in it?; is it burning down the cave?; do we need to run? It’s an instinctual response we have that many burners, who are experienced burners, have entirely learned to overcome. When a giant fireball goes off and the whole sky lights up, they just keep on talking. Two other people are jumping, like “what the fuck was that? Should I be scared?” And they’re like “No, no, it’s fine! It’s just some asshole with his flame effects.”
You mean you. You’re the asshole with the flame effects. [We laugh together, for I know first hand about Pyrocelt’s large (and loud) poofers.] Hah! Yeah, that’s me. One of my flame effects has what’s called “The Enhanced Noise Feature.” That’s a concoction I don’t suggest anyone do. It’s a way of adding oxygen into a post burn chamber that makes a ridiculously loud CRACK! I mentioned before that Deerfields, where Transformus happened for a number of years, thirteen I think, you could have unlimited noise and never get noise complaints. The first noise complaint I think Deerfields ever got was from my flame effect. The neighbors who were, I’m pretty sure, about a mile away, said their windows were literally rattling in their frames. It’s a very loud, very concerning effect. It’s a lot of fun to do. [...] The whole back of your
neck just jumps like “AHH! That’s a very loud noise!” 128
 
RER (41:25):
PC (41:48):
Would you say that there are other types of aural burn archetypes, like the sounds of fire, I would say, is an archetype of burn sounds?
Right. There’s a lot of them. There’s the drunken hoards you’ll find around. There’s the people on their little experiences in their little groups playing here or there. There’s frolicking in the water, if you have water available. You can sometimes tell what’s going on. There’s a lot of different soundscapes in that regard. I think I have a story about finding people through the soundscapes. Like sometimes you can just go to a neighborhood and just listen and see where people are. [...] You can walk into a neighborhood and listen and see where the people are still up, chippering away and whatever they’re doing.
So sound is an indicator for you about where to go.
Right.
Interesting. Is it ever the opposite? Is sound ever an indicator of where not to go?
That’s a good question. If I don’t want to hang out with the drunken hoards, yes. If you don’t want to interrupt your friends having sex, yes, though that’s not always something I care about necessarily.
What about like silence? Does lack of sound ever tell you as much as sound could at a burn?
Often that boring things are happening there. Or that nothing’s happening there at all.

What role do you think that sound plays in your personal burn experience, if any?
I like good music. That’s good. I like places I can go and dance. Hopefully with not just house. I like good house, that’s hard to describe what’s bad house but there’s a lot of bad house out there. Not bad house, just repetitive house. The BPM doesn’t change substantially and the music doesn’t change substantially, that’s not a place I’m going to stay for very long. I like bass, I like good bass systems. [...] I seek out places that have a good sound texture.
More about speakers. [...] The bass experience. So you put your fingers in your ears and you put your head inside the conch shell design on your hands and knees crawling into the bass speaker. It’s pretty epic. You can feel all of your insides rumbling; your brain rumbles and your chest rumbles, you can feel it in your gut, it’s a lot of fun. I call it the bass experience. It’s one of my favorite things to do. It’s a neat way to feel the bass rumbling through your body. In terms of soundscapes at burns, it’s probably my favorite sound there.
Interesting. That like, sound as vibration as much as you can possibly feel it.

What do you think, if anything, placing sound at the center of our thinking, can teach us about Burning Man culture?
I think it has a few interesting relationships with Burning Man culture. One is its freedom. It’s interesting to be at a place to have freedom to do what you want, to make the sounds you want. We’ve been talking about the nice polite sounds. We’ve not talked about, perhaps some of my more favorite sounds, the assholes on megaphones. Which I absolutely adore. It’s part of the culture of Burning Man culture that goes back a very long time. Being full of information and misinformation. My friend one year went around announcing that an acid rain cloud was coming in that would melt your skin. “Please leave Transformus, the burn is pretty much cancelled and only come back if you buy five pounds of baking soda to neutralize it.” They finally track him down when the people at the gate were like, “why is everyone leaving?” And people were like “we heard acid rain was coming!” The level of pranksters is inherent to burns itself and goes back to the very foundations of burns. And is expressed through sound culture, if you will.
                                                      
160 Pyrocelt’s interest in using his body to feel vibration (a theme I noticed at burns, such as “Audio Feel Ya”’s dance floor that vibrated to music at Wickerman), speaks to Helmreich’s (2015) ideas about the human body as a transducer.
  
131
RER (59:16): We were at Alchemy together when, because of the drought/burn ban, they could not burn the effigy. I was wondering about your thoughts on that.
PC (1:00:13): What is the sound of blue balls? That’s really my thoughts. It was very strange. The whole event was very strange with no burn. Other burns have dealt with this. But it was big culmination coming together and no crescendo after it, which was weird. Tiny Camp definitely saved the day. Tiny Camp is a camp where everything is miniaturized, so it’s all six inches tall. And they burned a six-inch effigy, which is pretty awesome. We all cried and cheered and ran around it when it was done burning. And then there were camps that had big projection screens showing the highlights of past Alchemys back when Alchemy actually burned their effigy. So you could see like, you know, what it looked like last year, or the year before.
RER (1:04:40):Do you think about sound elements purposefully when you’re building your flame effects? Or is it after the fact?
PC (1:04:58): I wish I could have more control over which effects make cool sounds. When I do have cool sounds, I try to capitalize on them as much as I can.
I have one effect that makes an interesting noise that makes your neck crawl everything time it fires. It’s a little bit jarring, it’s almost metallic. That one’s awesome. The ones I have that have the big oxygen enhancement, those clearly I was going for a big noise. I had no idea what
 
it would actually do. It did make a very pleasing repercussion that could 132
 
133
be heard from “Elysium Fields” to “Valhalla” [two of Transformus’ neighborhoods]. I do like to figure out how to make noise fun. Noise is often related to the amount of fire you have. Another interesting soundscape at burns that I adore [is this flame effect that] makes this popping noise. They’re a really neat effect. Another funny thing is, the first few times you fire dance, it’s always shocking to hear the sound of the fire all around you. It’s very distracting and not what you would expect.
APPENDIX C TIGER INTERVIEW
Informant Description and Transcription of Notable Dialogue My third interview was with Tiger, a twenty-six-year-old female from Philadelphia. She has attended five regional burns: Frostburn 2015 and 2016,
Transformus 2015 and 2016, and Playa Del Fuego 2016. Tiger first started fire-spinning at Transformus 2015 and has since then become an avid learner and performer. We briefly spoke in person on April 1, 2017 to discuss the aural aspects of fire-spinning. The interview lasted eight minutes and twenty-seven seconds.
RER (0:11):
TGR (0:16):
I’m curious about the sound elements of fire-spinning. So I’m just going to leave that open at first and see what you say in response to that.
So what I really like about the sound of fire-spinning and I’m sure you’ve heard it if you’ve stood near a fire-spinner. You get this “WHOOOSH!” And it whips around your head and its less like the flame and it’s more like the motion of the flame through the air. So if you’re spinning different objects, they sound different. Like, my stick sounds different than poi. And when I’m spinning dragon-staff, specifically when I’m spinning with other people, it has a really different sound. Like, dragon- staff, because its constantly spinning, its constantly in motion and its constantly whipping around itself, you get a lot of “whoosh.” And then the “whoosh” quiets down the more you go, so like sometimes when I’m spinning and I’m out with everybody, especially if we’re playing music, the first maybe forty-five seconds—I wish it was longer, you really only
134
 
RER (1:46):
TGR (2:03):
get maybe two minutes out of a spin—I’m just spinning to the sound of my own fire. After that it gets quieter as the fuel burns off and there’s less flame in the air and then you can kind of hear the music and the people around you again. But those first couple seconds are just so zen, where you’re just completely surrounded by your own flame and sound and you can’t really hear anything beyond you. I like it.
So, like... is sound then an indicator to you when its time to get more fuel, or when its time to stop, or when something’s wrong?
Yeah, actually we got a real good indication when something was wrong when we mixed fuels by accident. So we used denatured alcohol and somebody didn’t realize that our fuel dump had denatured alcohol in it and we topped it off with Coleman’s camp fuel. And it was popping and cracking and it was super obvious that something was wrong. Because of the sound it was making. It wasn’t making that “whoosh.” With denatured alcohol it’s a really quiet burn, you almost can’t hear anything. But it was this cracking and popping and it was less visual that cued me that something was wrong. Part of it was visual cause I knew that I was burning regular camp fuel and it was this really low low low flame that looked like denatured. But more so than that, when I first lit it, it POPPED. And it made this crazy noise and I knew immediately that something was up.
When it comes to newer burners or older burners who are watching fire-
spinners, do you think the sound makes a difference to them? 135
RER (3:08):
 
TGR (3:33):
Uh, no. I would say that, particularly if you’re not the one spinning it’s much more spectacle. Ya know? Even really big moves, so like, even things that make a really loud noise when you first off, like any sort of burn off: a burner has a stick and they flip it and it goes “whoosh” and it sends a big burst of flame into the air, or with dragon-staff we do like the “ghost rider tire tracks.” It’s visual, I think, for the people who aren’t surrounded by the flames themselves. Cause the sound isn’t loud enough or startling enough like the way a poofer could be, to actually capture your attention more than what you’re seeing.
What about for newer fire-spinners?
I think it’s almost a little bit startling. Like, I remember when I was first starting, the heat was obvious to me the first time I spun, but the second time that I spun and I was little bit more calm and a little bit more comfortable and I was with a bigger stick, so I wasn’t actually lighting my elbows on fire, it almost took me off guard how loud it was. Like, you don’t hear it until you’re in the middle of it. It’s like having ear buds in. Nobody else can hear it quite the way that you can, because its surrounding you on both sides. You don’t get that until you’re actually the one spinning it.
And now? And someone who’s more experienced?
Now I really get into the “whoosh” and the sound of it. Particularly when I don’t like the music that’s playing. And music I think is really important
to fire-spinners. A lot of them talk about how when someone gives them a 136
RER (4:22): TGR (4:26):
RER (5:13): TGR (5:15):
 
RER (5:55):
TGR (6:06):
good set to spin to and any sort of motion activity/dancing like this, music is awesome... it just makes it better. But when I don’t like the music, I get really into the sound of my own stick. I like listening to it flip around my head and I pay more attention to that sound as my soundtrack, to whatever else is going on.
Is there anything else you want to share with me before I shut off my recorder?
Maybe something about how important sound is and how important audio cues are to spinners. So for like a safety, something that’s really difficult to learn and goes against your intuition as a safety, is that your responsibility is not to put the fire out on somebody, but to let them know that they’re on fire, because they, most of the time, can put out the fire themselves. Being able to talk to a spinner in the way that they understand... like “Jessie, right leg” is super important. And you would think that the responsibility of a safety would be physical, to run in and put the fire out. But in reality, it’s all audio cues. It’s like “hey, Sean, you lit your shirt on fire again, right in the front, put it out.” It goes against all your instincts. Cause when you first start safety-ing, you’re like “AH! Fire! Uhhh, oh my god, I wanna put it out!” And that’s not helpful to spinners. It just gets in their way and you’re actually putting yourself in danger. It’s a really important thing when you have a good safety, for that safety to be able to know your name, be really loud, be able to single you
137
 
 
138
out in a crowd, is something that you don’t really think of, as the way you would put out a fire.
APPENDIX D JESSIE INTERVIEW
Informant Description and Transcription of Notable Dialogue
My fourth interview was with regional burner Jessie, a twenty-eight-year-old
female from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Jessie has been burning for the past ten years, has served on Frostburn’s Board of Directors since 2013 and has been coordinating placement at Frostburn since 2012. We spoke on the phone on April 6, 2017 to discuss how sound is involved in Frostburn’s placement process. The interview lasted twelve minutes and forty-nine seconds.
RER (0:08):
JT (0:19):
I just have some questions about how sound goes into the placement process for Frostburn.
Oh it absolutely affects placement. We don’t get the benefit of tree cover and that kind of stuff to dampen sound. Frostburn is a winter burn. The cold air sound is going to move a lot farther than if it had moisture in it. We have to be careful about where we put the sound camps. I don’t know if you noticed, but this year the sound camps were more on the perimeter than ever before. I’m really lucky because I have a couple people who run the sound camps who are really heavily invested in Frostburn and have been helping with placement for that. We talk to all theme camps about angling speakers. That kind of stuff.
So like the speakers get angled away from the interior portions of where all the theme camps are placed?
139
 
RER (1:11):
JT (1:14):
We like to do that yeah. We also try to keep them from being pointed at the main entrance, because that’s where our land neighbors are. But also I’ve found that it’s been good process to ask theme camps to point their own speakers toward their own sleeping areas. Frostburn is such a small community of people, that you can’t really escape it if it’s super loud. You have a number of theme camps that apply every year. How do you decide where to put each theme camp?
First I take into account whether they are, or are not, a sound camp. That is my top priority. Because sound camps get placed a little bit different. From there I look to see who they requested to be neighbors with, because if a camp who isn’t classified as a sound camp wants to neighbor with a sound camp, that kind of solves the problem for me. Because I like to add space between sound camps with camps that aren’t going to be super loud, but don’t mind being in a loud area.
Other than the sound camps is there any rhyme or reason for how the other camps are placed?
There’s an area that is higher traffic within Frostburn. Camps that are put on the ends are either sound camps or what I think of as “destination camps,” someone that draws a lot of people. Like, “White Dragon Noodle Bar” has a specific event every single day that happens at a certain time of day like clockwork. People always go to it. “Priority Five” is another one that I think of as an anchor camp. I don’t worry, because people are going
to want to go there, so they anchor another end of the theme camp area. 140
RER (2:08):
JT (2:29):
RER (3:07):
JT (3:45):
 
RER (6:13):
JT (6:35):
Is there anything else that comes to mind about how sound is incorporated into the burn or burn placement?
We normally only have two larger scale sound camps. I have designated spots at this point on my blank placement map with notes on it and there are three spots that are good for sound camps. They won’t interfere with each other, their speakers are facing in different directions, and its all going to be okay. After that, I’m not entirely sure what I would do next. [If there were more sound camps...] Whether that would mean changing up which part of the land we camp at on location, or what. Sound camps have always been the hardest part of placement for me.
Why is that?
Just because I don’t want the music to interfere with each other, I want to make sure that as much as possible, the music isn’t bothering other camps, especially other camps that do lower volume audio. Like “Camp Illumination,” they play movies. You can’t hear an outdoor style movie if the music is too loud from two camps over. It’s a balance between everyone getting to do what they want and being able to do what they want, which is different.
I’m thinking of an event at Frostburn, where a theme camp pumped up their music even louder at around seven-thirty in the morning, around the time when everyone is finally ready to go to bed. The thinking of that is “radical self-expression” of the theme camp versus consent issues, because
sound is something where you can’t shut your ears, but you can shut your 141
RER (7:29): JT (7:30):
RER (8:13):
 
JT (9:07):
eyes, so I’m wondering if you have any thoughts about those types of problems that arise at all burns.
I’ve found that the best answer to that as placement coordinator is to talk to the camps directly and to ask. I’ve never run into an issue. You get better results from asking than telling; having a conversation with a person and not making them feel forced into doing a thing.

APPENDIX E JOANNA INTERVIEW
Informant Description and Transcription of Notable Dialogue My fifth interview was with JoAnna, a twenty-nine-year-old female from
Annapolis, Maryland. JoAnna and I met at Transformus 2015 and have since run into each other at a handful of regional burns and burn-related events. JoAnna has been attending burns since 2011 and is an active member of the regional burn community. She is an interactive fire artist, with creations such as her flaming tetherball court and flaming croquet. I contacted JoAnna because I was interested in hearing her thoughts on heckling and whether or not she believed that burners’ reactions to heckling indicated their experience level. We spoke on the phone on April 11, 2017. The interview lasted fifteen minutes and fifty-nine seconds.
RER (0:25):
JG (0:38):
So I’m wondering if you can tell me, from your perspective, what happened that day when a bunch of people walked up to us and asked if what we were doing (putting Josephine together) was acroyoga.
First day at Transformus I rolled in with Christian and Jess, the creators of “Josephine the Colossal Skeleton Marionette.” And we were getting her all set up. She’s a giant, two-story, skeleton marionette that you can control from seven different points. While we’re climbing all over this thing with power tools, a group of hippies meander up to us and they’re like “is this where acroyoga is?” And that just struck me as so absurd. So of course I said “yes, absolutely. This is where acroyoga is. Josephine
will be leading acroyoga.” And they’re like “great!” And we just went 143
 
RER (2:14):
JG (2:23):
back to work... and they stood there. Waiting for acroyoga to start. We let them wait for quite a while. I didn’t tell them it wasn’t acroyoga... but someone did. You were going along with it. It really was very easy to convince them that a giant skeleton puppet was going to be their acroyoga teacher. [...] That’s like standard operating procedure for me. I’m here to make dreams come true. I’m not here to help.
It became clear to me that they didn’t know what acroyoga was. So like, they didn’t know what to expect also.
Oh! [She contemplates this.] It was just so absurd, like, at “Figment,” someone was like, “where’s the bike valet?” I’m like “oh! Just go over to the tutu tent. They’ll check you in there.” ...Who has a bike valet? But they sure as shit walked their bikes up to the tutu tent and tried to check in with the tutu ladies.
No. Were they serious? Or were they fucking with you too?
Dead serious. And you know, I was professional. I had a radio and a t- shirt, but, a bike valet? Really?
[So the acroyoga group...] I didn’t ask them, specifically if they were virgins, but would you think that that was their first burn?
Plausibly. The thing is, there’s so many different types. Maybe it wasn’t their first burn, but they clearly... something wasn’t registering, for whatever reason. They could just be space cadets. There’s no way they were the jaded old fucks. The fact that they were following a program and
trying to show up to an appointment showed that they weren’t really 144

acclimated. And then they waited for it. They hadn’t really gotten the whole “immediacy” thing, now that I’m analyzing it. I didn’t think of any of this when I was just bullshitting. But there’s different types of heckling. I consider myself a very passive and personal heckler. But there’s the megaphone and most people who heckle are the megaphone hecklers. I can’t stand megaphones. I feel like the quintessential example is when me and my old roommate did detention for “Breakfast Club Detention Camp.” She would be the one heckling with the megaphone. The idea was that we would give people detention sometimes before we would give them breakfast. We’d spank them or whatever crazy punishment, but then we’d bring them to the front of the line and feed them breakfast. She’d be up there with the megaphone and I’d go toe-to- toe with a guy who is like, naked. And I’d be like “...where are your socks? How could you show up to breakfast without your socks?” If someone asks me a question, I may not give them an honest answer. Like, our theme camp one year was “Chaos Motel.” And I was the concierge. My name for that burn was “Miss Information.” It was a lot of fun.
What sorts of things did you do?
Mostly giving people wrong answers and making suggestions that made no sense at all. We had a “not here to help” desk. I don’t think I ever sat at it, because that would be far too easy.
Okay, so I guess my hypothesis here is that the way in which people
respond to heckling is an indicator as to someone’s experience level. 145
JG (8:19):
So a lot of the times people believe me. This time, this was too easy. But I have to watch it. I’m in charge sometimes and I’m very good at being authoritative. The megaphone heckling can be way more abrasive, but you know you’re being heckled. I won’t embarrass you in the moment, per se. But I may make you feel like an idiot after if you stop and think about the interaction. Because of the heckling I do, it’s mostly giving absurd answers to absurd questions and experienced people know better. So my interactions from them are very different. I think you might be right with the more obvious heckling... but other ones, I’m not sure. What are you basing your hypothesis on, if you don’t mind me asking?
[I then shared with her Pyrocelt’s story about his friend heckling people about the acid rain cloud. We both laugh.]
Oh. My God. Yeah, I mean once you’ve rodeoed, you know better, probably. So in that way, I’m sure they do respond differently. I think it also depends on the person. I did an art project that was just a big heckle gag at Freeform. Some people got really into it and other people were totally turned off. Which was fine. [...] I think that’s more of a how- into-this-game-and-the-shenanigans are you? You know?
It’s definitely a very specific type of humor.
I love it.
And it requires two people to play, you know?
That’s what is awesome about it. It’s interactive, you know?
